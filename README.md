# 🛒 Amazon E-Commerce Real-Time Analytics Pipeline

## 📖 Project Overview
In this project, I engineered an **end-to-end real-time data pipeline** to analyze **Amazon products & customer reviews**.  
The project leverages **Azure Databricks, ADLS Gen2, Delta Lake, Power BI, PySpark, and RapidAPI** to deliver **business-ready insights**.

The pipeline ingests **real-time data** from Amazon (via RapidAPI), processes it through the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**, and generates insights for **product sales trends and customer sentiment analysis**.
