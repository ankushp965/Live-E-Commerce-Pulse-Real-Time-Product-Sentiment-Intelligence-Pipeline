R3IP3AW6JCCIH6,EXCELLENT PHONE & BEYOND AMAZING SELLER/CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!,"I honestly can‚Äôt say enough amazing things about my experience buying a renewed iPhone 11 from this seller and dealing with their customer service! I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won‚Äôt be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.

My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn‚Äôt brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.

The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn‚Äôt love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn‚Äôt deliver it until 10pm! But that‚Äôs an issue with UPS, not the seller.

When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn‚Äôt pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn‚Äôt great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.

The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they‚Äôd overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn‚Äôt be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they‚Äôd overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn‚Äôt want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I‚Äôd reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I‚Äôd be sending it back with it on.

Life got hectic and I didn‚Äôt reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.

I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn‚Äôt ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn‚Äôt want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don‚Äôt have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.

When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn‚Äôt going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).

When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn‚Äôt a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It‚Äôs also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!

I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!

Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IP3AW6JCCIH6,AGV4EJPKXIBH34HA77QD7KJF4SCQ,Chely,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGV4EJPKXIBH34HA77QD7KJF4SCQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2024",True,119 people found this helpful,B07ZPKN6YR,False

R397MZVJXW7B2Q,Phone is great! Shipping & setup frustrating,"The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.

[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]

My issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.
1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we‚Äôd be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.

2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website. Hope others have an easier time with setup.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R397MZVJXW7B2Q,AF5X3FEWZIKP5MXF23CSVCCIMRYA,TreeSaw R,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF5X3FEWZIKP5MXF23CSVCCIMRYA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2023",True,61 people found this helpful,B084GXMHBQ,False

RK768BU3IYLYD,Apple iPhone 11 Review: A Reliable Backup That Feels Like New,"Update:  I'm back with an update on our journey with the iPhone 11, and let me tell you, it's been quite the rollercoaster. Initially, I bought one for my daughter from a different seller, and it was, to put it mildly, a bit of a disaster. We had issues left and right ‚Äì Face ID not working, the phone overheating ‚Äì you name it. So, we returned it, feeling a bit skeptical about the whole refurbished scene.

But here's where the plot twists: we decided to give it another go, this time purchasing from the Amazon resellers store, specifically from a shop called Hybrid IT. And oh boy, what a difference! The iPhone we received this time around was nothing short of impeccable. It arrived with all the essentials ‚Äì a charger, a charging cable, and even a SIM card tool, all neatly packed. The phone itself? It could've fooled me for brand new.

This experience really hammered home the lesson that when it comes to refurbished goods, the ""who"" is just as crucial as the ""what."" The quality and condition of the product can vary wildly depending on the seller. Hybrid IT sent out an excellent product that exceeded our expectations in every way.

For those of you wary about diving into the world of refurbished electronics, let this be a testament. With the right seller, you can get your hands on a device that feels brand new, without the hefty price tag. We're over the moon with our iPhone 11, and I'll be sure to keep you all posted if anything changes. But for now, it seems like we've struck gold.

--------------------

I recently found myself in need of a quick replacement after my daughter accidentally broke her phone. The Apple iPhone 11, 64GB in black, seemed like a promising choice, primarily because we needed something that could be set up swiftly and would perform seamlessly as a backup.

Out of the box, the iPhone 11 felt like a brand-new device despite being a model released a few years back. The sleek black finish and the familiar design immediately caught my eye, reassuring me that this choice would not disappoint.

Setting up the iPhone 11 was mostly straightforward, especially with the unlocked version making it easy to switch from the old device. The transfer of data and settings from the previous iPhone was seamless, thanks to Apple's ecosystem. However, we hit a slight snag with the Face ID setup - it took a bit longer than expected to get it working properly. Despite this hiccup, once configured, Face ID has been working flawlessly.

The iPhone 11's performance has been impressive. The touch screen is responsive, making navigation and typing a breeze. Wi-Fi connectivity is fast, ensuring that browsing and app downloads are efficient. Although it's not the latest model, it handles everyday tasks with ease, from streaming video content to gaming, without any noticeable lag.

The main issue we encountered was the initial difficulty in setting up Face ID. It required a few attempts to configure, which was a minor inconvenience in an otherwise smooth setup process. After overcoming this challenge, the phone has been working perfectly.

Overall, this refurbished Apple iPhone 11 has proven to be a reliable and efficient backup phone. Its ease of setup, fast Wi-Fi, and responsive touch screen make it feel like a new device. The hiccup with Face ID setup was a small obstacle that, once overcome, didn't detract from the overall positive experience. I would recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone in need of a quick replacement or a dependable backup device",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK768BU3IYLYD,AG63VV75B2JXABUVNFAAN4W7Q3DQ,Ms D,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG63VV75B2JXABUVNFAAN4W7Q3DQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/31610bf7-4102-4e06-88cf-4019c6b68068._CR0,0,500,500_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2024",True,145 people found this helpful,B07ZPKN6YR,False

RSVGACWFTNLHY,"Nice phone, decent price","I needed a new unlocked iPhone for my wife, since her 6 plus cannot run on any recent IOS iterations and is getting dropped by our mobile carrier.  Sooo, a used 11 seemed a logical choice, since her needs are minimal.  I have one as well and love it (no plans to upgrade).

After hunting around for about a week, I finally committed.  The phone arrived early and properly packaged.  There were some scratches on the edges, but only one of note.  It even had a (perfect) screen protector.  It was unlocked, easy to set up, and seems to run flawlessly.  The battery reserve so far is okay, although iPhone Settings claim it is an aftermarket replacement, and cannot tell me anything about battery health.  Battery issues ae commonly reported with used phones, but mine seems fine.

A couple of minor issues.  While the edge scratches were not functional, they were borderline for condition rated as ""excellent.""  Also, when ordering, play the extra $5 for FedEx or UPS delivery.  Ours came USPS and arrived unexpected early.  It was left on the top of our mailbox, but I was able to get it before heading off for a short trip.

To sum up, this was a good phone at a decent price (about$225 with 128 GB memory).  When my phone needs replacement, I would go with this seller again, but would not buy anything rated less than ""excellent condition"".",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSVGACWFTNLHY,AH244HRSCOODMNS6APR2DVHOXHAQ,RickS,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH244HRSCOODMNS6APR2DVHOXHAQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oNrKSM1PL.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Wt4dyJbOL.jpg']",,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2025",True,12 people found this helpful,B07ZPK3KWH,False

If you're in the market for a smartphone that seamlessly marries cutting-edge technology with sleek design, look no further than the Apple iPhone 11. As a devoted Apple enthusiast, I recently upgraded to this model, and I must say, it's exceeded my already high expectations.

Let's start with the design. The iPhone 11 boasts a stunning 6.1-inch Liquid Retina HD display that truly brings everything to life, from vibrant photos to immersive gaming experiences. The build quality is impeccable, with a robust aerospace-grade aluminum and glass construction that feels premium in the hand. The matte finish on the back not only looks sophisticated but also minimizes fingerprints, which is a practical touch.

Performance-wise, the iPhone 11 is a powerhouse. The A13 Bionic chip ensures lightning-fast responsiveness, whether you're multitasking between apps, editing videos on the go, or playing graphics-intensive games. This phone handles it all effortlessly. Plus, with iOS, you get the smoothest, most intuitive user experience in the smartphone world. Updates are timely, and the ecosystem seamlessly integrates with other Apple devices if you're part of the ecosystem.

Now, let's talk about the camera setup‚Äîa standout feature of the iPhone 11. The dual-camera system (12MP Ultra Wide and Wide cameras) captures stunning photos with impressive detail and color accuracy. Night mode is a game-changer, allowing you to take beautifully illuminated shots even in low-light conditions. The ability to shoot 4K videos at 60fps with extended dynamic range further showcases the iPhone 11's imaging prowess.

Battery life has been another pleasant surprise. The iPhone 11 easily lasts me through a full day of heavy use, thanks to optimizations in hardware and software. Fast charging support means I can quickly top up when needed, which is incredibly convenient.

As for connectivity, having the iPhone 11 unlocked gives me the flexibility to switch between carriers without any hassle. It supports 4G LTE and the latest Wi-Fi standards, ensuring a stable and speedy connection wherever I go.

In terms of value, the iPhone 11 hits the sweet spot. It offers flagship-level performance and features without the premium price tag of the Pro models. The 64GB storage variant provides ample space for apps, photos, and videos, but you can always opt for higher capacities if needed.

In conclusion, the Apple iPhone 11 is a triumph of design, performance, and value. Whether you're an Apple aficionado or simply looking for a top-tier smartphone experience, this device delivers on all fronts. It's reliable, versatile, and beautifully crafted‚Äîa true testament to Apple's commitment to innovation. I wholeheartedly recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone seeking a dependable and feature-rich mobile companion.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U7NML74KC33D,AFOILPY5YDLSECPUBBVNIKDYXS5A,AOP3D 5 WHISTLESTOP MALL  ROCKPORT MA,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFOILPY5YDLSECPUBBVNIKDYXS5A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/4356084d-0615-4e67-8ab1-78e0a1f9352b._CR109,0,281,281_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2024",True,47 people found this helpful,B07ZPKN6YR,False

R252WKP0RQ1Z5U,Phone as described,"EDIT: Our daughter was given the phone a few days ago and it has been working great! There is one spot on the right side of the screen that is lighter than anywhere else. The only thing I can think of that would be causing it is something underneath is pressing up against the back side of a recently replaced screen. It's there regardless of what is showing on the screen. All colors and any image and you can still see a small white area that never gets color and then fades into the normal looking screen. It's so small, it's almost unnoticeable. I only put it in the review in case it is indeed something behind the screen and eventually causes issues. Currently, I am happy with the phone. Our daughter loves it and it appears to function perfectly!

Original Review: So far the phone is great! There doesn't appear to be any cosmetic issues at all. The phone turned on, loaded up and accepted my daughter's account login. Battery health is perfect, storage capacity is correct for my order. We won't actually be giving it to our daughter till her birthday in a couple weeks but preliminary inspection went well. Will update the review once we start actually using it but I am happy with the phone so far

RJKYJ325DBHJ8,Purple iPhone 11~,"I ordered this phone and received it in less than 4 days. I chose the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition out of all the renewed options. It is a lot bigger than I expected, but then again, I didn‚Äôt check the dimensions before I ordered it. The phone was packaged in a single bubble wrap sleeve. The box it came in contained a wall adapter and charging cable. The phone is almost flawless except for some scuff marks around the charging port. There are also some scuff marks around the volume up button.

I like that the color of the iPhone is a muted lavender color rather than a vibrant purple. The phone came with a screen protector already installed. I didn‚Äôt realize this until hours later while I was setting up the phone. The battery health is set at 90%, and this was written on the bubble wrap sleeve.

The one thing I will say about this phone is that it does lack a working left speaker on the bottom. The other reviews all seem to mention the speaker problem, and I hate to agree.

R24UHNO96A74VP,Looks brand new and I love it! iPhone 6 to 11,"My iPhone 6 died and was only iOS 10 so it was time to get a new phone. After much deliberation I decided to buy the Apple iPhone 11, US Version, 128GB, Green - Unlocked (Renewed) and couldn't be happier. It looks brand new, literally not one scuff mark, the battery was at 82% life but for $329.00 I got the phone, a charger (cord and block) and a clear protective case with iOS 16 installed. Way cheaper than buying new. I also liked that it's not a huge phone, 6.1 inches.

I was concerned as my old phone completely died so I wasn't sure how to get Apple ID and all on the new phone as I don't have a landline or other phone. I googled and learned to just select lost password at the Apple ID prompt, it allowed me to reset my Apple password by asking for my old phone's passcode to open.  The sim card transfer was a piece of cake too for this non techy.  I love all the new things the iPhone 11 can do, easier deleting some things, the camera is better and wide lens, more emojis for texting, etc. I haven't charged the phone at all since 6:00 AM this morning and have been playing with it, updating apps, installing, etc. and the battery is still going strong from this morning.

When you get the phone it walks you through set up which just took a few minutes. Meaning it let me enter a new password, set up my language, time zone, etc. I believe it asked about font size, etc as well, it was all easy setup - nothing really stymied me which I was grateful for.

To put it through its paces, I emailed, texted, called, received calls, took photos, surfed the net, downloaded form the App store, etc and thus far no issues and at this point I don't anticipate any.

Spending the additional $$ for the latest and supposedly greatest iPhone isn't necessary for me - and I don't have to deal with ""new"" issues the latest phones sometimes have.

While the phone ‚Äúworks‚Äù, I‚Äôm left feeling disappointed by the condition it arrived in.

7Q5C9CZ6Z6MB915,Great phone for moderate use.,"The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.

[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]

My issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.
1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we‚Äôd be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.

2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website. Hope others have an easier time with setup.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/3ON6EKW2J411S4M,XG0VX0WMF0PXY2A,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.7KDI0U4CQPO4H4Q,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2025",False,,EM9BUXATLK,False

AZ4H94HZ8WIPAQI,iPhone review,"I honestly can‚Äôt say enough amazing things about my experience buying a renewed iPhone 11 from this seller and dealing with their customer service! I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won‚Äôt be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.

My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn‚Äôt brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.

The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn‚Äôt love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn‚Äôt deliver it until 10pm! But that‚Äôs an issue with UPS, not the seller.

When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn‚Äôt pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn‚Äôt great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.

The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they‚Äôd overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn‚Äôt be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they‚Äôd overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn‚Äôt want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I‚Äôd reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I‚Äôd be sending it back with it on.

Life got hectic and I didn‚Äôt reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.

I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn‚Äôt ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn‚Äôt want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don‚Äôt have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.

When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn‚Äôt going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).

When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn‚Äôt a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It‚Äôs also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!

I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!

Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!",1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/BBH2LDUEIHYK2JT,Z9HWBKJ4KANFC1E,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.7QNKNKE0TW8CHER,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2025",False,,BQBDS1MGXJ,True

WN3N96SXE3AJB2N,Highly Recommend,"EDIT: Our daughter was given the phone a few days ago and it has been working great! There is one spot on the right side of the screen that is lighter than anywhere else. The only thing I can think of that would be causing it is something underneath is pressing up against the back side of a recently replaced screen. It's there regardless of what is showing on the screen. All colors and any image and you can still see a small white area that never gets color and then fades into the normal looking screen. It's so small, it's almost unnoticeable. I only put it in the review in case it is indeed something behind the screen and eventually causes issues. Currently, I am happy with the phone. Our daughter loves it and it appears to function perfectly!

Original Review: So far the phone is great! There doesn't appear to be any cosmetic issues at all. The phone turned on, loaded up and accepted my daughter's account login. Battery health is perfect, storage capacity is correct for my order. We won't actually be giving it to our daughter till her birthday in a couple weeks but preliminary inspection went well. Will update the review once we start actually using it but I am happy with the phone so far

DH55SPHIUBJVI51,Buyer beware,"The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.

[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]

My issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.
1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we‚Äôd be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.

2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website. Hope others have an easier time with setup.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/Q4B1CU6K71PD8YO,UPSZXOJJPYV7SKC,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.52A08RV2UTNJYG8,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on May 04, 2025",False,,1G9R8M1P4R,True

9J1RQ3ZFTEMIHKD,.,"I ordered this phone and received it in less than 4 days. I chose the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition out of all the renewed options. It is a lot bigger than I expected, but then again, I didn‚Äôt check the dimensions before I ordered it. The phone was packaged in a single bubble wrap sleeve. The box it came in contained a wall adapter and charging cable. The phone is almost flawless except for some scuff marks around the charging port. There are also some scuff marks around the volume up button.

I like that the color of the iPhone is a muted lavender color rather than a vibrant purple. The phone came with a screen protector already installed. I didn‚Äôt realize this until hours later while I was setting up the phone. The battery health is set at 90%, and this was written on the bubble wrap sleeve.

The one thing I will say about this phone is that it does lack a working left speaker on the bottom. The other reviews all seem to mention the speaker problem, and I hate to agree. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but I do wish the audio was up to par with the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition the phone is supposed to be in.

By the way, this phone was sold to me by Electronic Deals. They seem to have a slightly above average reputation. I love the fact it has 128gb of storage. I upgraded from a refurbished iPhone 7, and I think I made a good decision! I like my new phone.

T46GFORJSSU4BCD,Perfect!,"EDIT: Our daughter was given the phone a few days ago and it has been working great! There is one spot on the right side of the screen that is lighter than anywhere else. The only thing I can think of that would be causing it is something underneath is pressing up against the back side of a recently replaced screen. It's there regardless of what is showing on the screen. All colors and any image and you can still see a small white area that never gets color and then fades into the normal looking screen. It's so small, it's almost unnoticeable. I only put it in the review in case it is indeed something behind the screen and eventually causes issues. Currently, I am happy with the phone. Our daughter loves it and it appears to function perfectly!

Original Review: So far the phone is great! There doesn't appear to be any cosmetic issues at all. The phone turned on, loaded up and accepted my daughter's account login. Battery health is perfect, storage capacity is correct for my order. We won't actually be giving it to our daughter till her birthday in a couple weeks but preliminary inspection went well. Will update the review once we start actually using it but I am happy with the phone so far

QSEI7FD7A1OXVUV,Disappointed,"The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.

[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]

My issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.
1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we‚Äôd be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.

2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website. Hope others have an easier time with setup.",2,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/PKYPUUBDQRPJ7YH,Y6I8YF5YWRSNOJU,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.T43I1AA65PE8K1B,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on April 07, 2025",True,,TEX0I4TJRS,False

E32ESG7FLVOCT6G,nice,"My iPhone 6 died and was only iOS 10 so it was time to get a new phone. After much deliberation I decided to buy the Apple iPhone 11, US Version, 128GB, Green - Unlocked (Renewed) and couldn't be happier. It looks brand new, literally not one scuff mark, the battery was at 82% life but for $329.00 I got the phone, a charger (cord and block) and a clear protective case with iOS 16 installed. Way cheaper than buying new. I also liked that it's not a huge phone, 6.1 inches.

I was concerned as my old phone completely died so I wasn't sure how to get Apple ID and all on the new phone as I don't have a landline or other phone. I googled and learned to just select lost password at the Apple ID prompt, it allowed me to reset my Apple password by asking for my old phone's passcode to open.  The sim card transfer was a piece of cake too for this non techy.  I love all the new things the iPhone 11 can do, easier deleting some things, the camera is better and wide lens, more emojis for texting, etc. I haven't charged the phone at all since 6:00 AM this morning and have been playing with it, updating apps, installing, etc. and the battery is still going strong from this morning.

When you get the phone it walks you through set up which just took a few minutes. Meaning it let me enter a new password, set up my language, time zone, etc. I believe it asked about font size, etc as well, it was all easy setup - nothing really stymied me which I was grateful for.

To put it through its paces, I emailed, texted, called, received calls, took photos, surfed the net, downloaded form the App store, etc and thus far no issues and at this point I don't anticipate any.

Spending the additional $$ for the latest and supposedly greatest iPhone isn't necessary for me - and I don't have to deal with ""new"" issues the latest phones sometimes have.  In summary, I would definitely buy unlocked and renewed again.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/6WD8ADIBVUVW0WA,P43FM1J1LOZ456J,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.HQHAJ11WCQEDRH2,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on May 01, 2025",True,,KPH8JAG6IK,False

PY9Z4G9DBF56GFC,Amazing!,"EDIT: Our daughter was given the phone a few days ago and it has been working great! There is one spot on the right side of the screen that is lighter than anywhere else. The only thing I can think of that would be causing it is something underneath is pressing up against the back side of a recently replaced screen. It's there regardless of what is showing on the screen. All colors and any image and you can still see a small white area that never gets color and then fades into the normal looking screen. It's so small, it's almost unnoticeable. I only put it in the review in case it is indeed something behind the screen and eventually causes issues. Currently, I am happy with the phone. Our daughter loves it and it appears to function perfectly!

Original Review: So far the phone is great! There doesn't appear to be any cosmetic issues at all. The phone turned on, loaded up and accepted my daughter's account login. Battery health is perfect, storage capacity is correct for my order. We won't actually be giving it to our daughter till her birthday in a couple weeks but preliminary inspection went well. Will update the review once we start actually using it but I am happy with the phone so far

Y0PBKMUPL3IDZ6T,Buyer beware,"Update:  I'm back with an update on our journey with the iPhone 11, and let me tell you, it's been quite the rollercoaster. Initially, I bought one for my daughter from a different seller, and it was, to put it mildly, a bit of a disaster. We had issues left and right ‚Äì Face ID not working, the phone overheating ‚Äì you name it. So, we returned it, feeling a bit skeptical about the whole refurbished scene.

But here's where the plot twists: we decided to give it another go, this time purchasing from the Amazon resellers store, specifically from a shop called Hybrid IT. And oh boy, what a difference! The iPhone we received this time around was nothing short of impeccable. It arrived with all the essentials ‚Äì a charger, a charging cable, and even a SIM card tool, all neatly packed. The phone itself? It could've fooled me for brand new.

This experience really hammered home the lesson that when it comes to refurbished goods, the ""who"" is just as crucial as the ""what."" The quality and condition of the product can vary wildly depending on the seller. Hybrid IT sent out an excellent product that exceeded our expectations in every way.

For those of you wary about diving into the world of refurbished electronics, let this be a testament. With the right seller, you can get your hands on a device that feels brand new, without the hefty price tag. We're over the moon with our iPhone 11, and I'll be sure to keep you all posted if anything changes. But for now, it seems like we've struck gold.

--------------------

I recently found myself in need of a quick replacement after my daughter accidentally broke her phone. The Apple iPhone 11, 64GB in black, seemed like a promising choice, primarily because we needed something that could be set up swiftly and would perform seamlessly as a backup.

Out of the box, the iPhone 11 felt like a brand-new device despite being a model released a few years back. The sleek black finish and the familiar design immediately caught my eye, reassuring me that this choice would not disappoint.

Setting up the iPhone 11 was mostly straightforward, especially with the unlocked version making it easy to switch from the old device. The transfer of data and settings from the previous iPhone was seamless, thanks to Apple's ecosystem. However, we hit a slight snag with the Face ID setup - it took a bit longer than expected to get it working properly. Despite this hiccup, once configured, Face ID has been working flawlessly.

The iPhone 11's performance has been impressive. The touch screen is responsive, making navigation and typing a breeze. Wi-Fi connectivity is fast, ensuring that browsing and app downloads are efficient. Although it's not the latest model, it handles everyday tasks with ease, from streaming video content to gaming, without any noticeable lag.

The main issue we encountered was the initial difficulty in setting up Face ID. It required a few attempts to configure, which was a minor inconvenience in an otherwise smooth setup process. After overcoming this challenge, the phone has been working perfectly.

Overall, this refurbished Apple iPhone 11 has proven to be a reliable and efficient backup phone. Its ease of setup, fast Wi-Fi, and responsive touch screen make it feel like a new device. The hiccup with Face ID setup was a small obstacle that, once overcome, didn't detract from the overall positive experience. I would recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone in need of a quick replacement or a dependable backup device",1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/49SHI0FGRY6AS6H,PXHQVRJ9MF181OQ,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.1GPDJM52VR1MDLC,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2025",True,,VFYIFSNUKD,True

K8ZV19B5K1BF55Y,An Excellent Renewed Choice,"EDIT: Our daughter was given the phone a few days ago and it has been working great! There is one spot on the right side of the screen that is lighter than anywhere else. The only thing I can think of that would be causing it is something underneath is pressing up against the back side of a recently replaced screen. It's there regardless of what is showing on the screen. All colors and any image and you can still see a small white area that never gets color and then fades into the normal looking screen. It's so small, it's almost unnoticeable. I only put it in the review in case it is indeed something behind the screen and eventually causes issues. Currently, I am happy with the phone. Our daughter loves it and it appears to function perfectly!

Original Review: So far the phone is great! There doesn't appear to be any cosmetic issues at all. The phone turned on, loaded up and accepted my daughter's account login. Battery health is perfect, storage capacity is correct for my order. We won't actually be giving it to our daughter till her birthday in a couple weeks but preliminary inspection went well. Will update the review once we start actually using it but I am happy with the phone so far

Y2QWGWU2ZMHTQV6,Could be better,"I ordered this phone and received it in less than 4 days. I chose the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition out of all the renewed options. It is a lot bigger than I expected, but then again, I didn‚Äôt check the dimensions before I ordered it. The phone was packaged in a single bubble wrap sleeve. The box it came in contained a wall adapter and charging cable. The phone is almost flawless except for some scuff marks around the charging port. There are also some scuff marks around the volume up button.

I like that the color of the iPhone is a muted lavender color rather than a vibrant purple. The phone came with a screen protector already installed. I didn‚Äôt realize this until hours later while I was setting up the phone. The battery health is set at 90%, and this was written on the bubble wrap sleeve.

The one thing I will say about this phone is that it does lack a working left speaker on the bottom. The other reviews all seem to mention the speaker problem, and I hate to agree. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but I do wish the audio was up to par with the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition the phone is supposed to be in.

By the way, this phone was sold to me by Electronic Deals. They seem to have a slightly above average reputation. I love the fact it has 128gb of storage.

97493CH1U0PERQN,EXCELLENT PHONE & BEYOND AMAZING SELLER/CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!,"EDIT: Our daughter was given the phone a few days ago and it has been working great! There is one spot on the right side of the screen that is lighter than anywhere else. The only thing I can think of that would be causing it is something underneath is pressing up against the back side of a recently replaced screen. It's there regardless of what is showing on the screen. All colors and any image and you can still see a small white area that never gets color and then fades into the normal looking screen. It's so small, it's almost unnoticeable. I only put it in the review in case it is indeed something behind the screen and eventually causes issues. Currently, I am happy with the phone. Our daughter loves it and it appears to function perfectly!

Original Review: So far the phone is great! There doesn't appear to be any cosmetic issues at all. The phone turned on, loaded up and accepted my daughter's account login. Battery health is perfect, storage capacity is correct for my order. We won't actually be giving it to our daughter till her birthday in a couple weeks but preliminary inspection went well. Will update the review once we start actually using it but I am happy with the phone so far

90FK6VZYS801LSG,Love it!,"My iPhone 6 died and was only iOS 10 so it was time to get a new phone. After much deliberation I decided to buy the Apple iPhone 11, US Version, 128GB, Green - Unlocked (Renewed) and couldn't be happier. It looks brand new, literally not one scuff mark, the battery was at 82% life but for $329.00 I got the phone, a charger (cord and block) and a clear protective case with iOS 16 installed. Way cheaper than buying new. I also liked that it's not a huge phone, 6.1 inches.

I was concerned as my old phone completely died so I wasn't sure how to get Apple ID and all on the new phone as I don't have a landline or other phone. I googled and learned to just select lost password at the Apple ID prompt, it allowed me to reset my Apple password by asking for my old phone's passcode to open.  The sim card transfer was a piece of cake too for this non techy.  I love all the new things the iPhone 11 can do, easier deleting some things, the camera is better and wide lens, more emojis for texting, etc. I haven't charged the phone at all since 6:00 AM this morning and have been playing with it, updating apps, installing, etc. and the battery is still going strong from this morning.

When you get the phone it walks you through set up which just took a few minutes. Meaning it let me enter a new password, set up my language, time zone, etc. I believe it asked about font size, etc as well, it was all easy setup - nothing really stymied me which I was grateful for.

To put it through its paces, I emailed, texted, called, received calls, took photos, surfed the net, downloaded form the App store, etc and thus far no issues and at this point I don't anticipate any.

Spending the additional $$ for the latest and supposedly greatest iPhone isn't necessary for me - and I don't have to deal with ""new"" issues the latest phones sometimes have.  In summary, I would definitely buy unlocked and renewed again.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/A5BTZFZKG0NMQUL,JMCLIJ8WZ0PX4M5,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.ALMJEWT2O1NW5LY,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2025",True,,7GUOKIUHAF,True

SAJ7IUW8V7PRHGW,I do recommend,"Update:  I'm back with an update on our journey with the iPhone 11, and let me tell you, it's been quite the rollercoaster. Initially, I bought one for my daughter from a different seller, and it was, to put it mildly, a bit of a disaster. We had issues left and right ‚Äì Face ID not working, the phone overheating ‚Äì you name it. So, we returned it, feeling a bit skeptical about the whole refurbished scene.

But here's where the plot twists: we decided to give it another go, this time purchasing from the Amazon resellers store, specifically from a shop called Hybrid IT. And oh boy, what a difference! The iPhone we received this time around was nothing short of impeccable. It arrived with all the essentials ‚Äì a charger, a charging cable, and even a SIM card tool, all neatly packed. The phone itself? It could've fooled me for brand new.

This experience really hammered home the lesson that when it comes to refurbished goods, the ""who"" is just as crucial as the ""what."" The quality and condition of the product can vary wildly depending on the seller. Hybrid IT sent out an excellent product that exceeded our expectations in every way.

For those of you wary about diving into the world of refurbished electronics, let this be a testament. With the right seller, you can get your hands on a device that feels brand new, without the hefty price tag. We're over the moon with our iPhone 11, and I'll be sure to keep you all posted if anything changes. But for now, it seems like we've struck gold.

--------------------

I recently found myself in need of a quick replacement after my daughter accidentally broke her phone. The Apple iPhone 11, 64GB in black, seemed like a promising choice, primarily because we needed something that could be set up swiftly and would perform seamlessly as a backup.

Out of the box, the iPhone 11 felt like a brand-new device despite being a model released a few years back. The sleek black finish and the familiar design immediately caught my eye, reassuring me that this choice would not disappoint.

Setting up the iPhone 11 was mostly straightforward, especially with the unlocked version making it easy to switch from the old device. The transfer of data and settings from the previous iPhone was seamless, thanks to Apple's ecosystem. However, we hit a slight snag with the Face ID setup - it took a bit longer than expected to get it working properly. Despite this hiccup, once configured, Face ID has been working flawlessly.

The iPhone 11's performance has been impressive. The touch screen is responsive, making navigation and typing a breeze. Wi-Fi connectivity is fast, ensuring that browsing and app downloads are efficient. Although it's not the latest model, it handles everyday tasks with ease, from streaming video content to gaming, without any noticeable lag.

The main issue we encountered was the initial difficulty in setting up Face ID. It required a few attempts to configure, which was a minor inconvenience in an otherwise smooth setup process. After overcoming this challenge, the phone has been working perfectly.

Overall, this refurbished Apple iPhone 11 has proven to be a reliable and efficient backup phone. Its ease of setup, fast Wi-Fi, and responsive touch screen make it feel like a new device. The hiccup with Face ID setup was a small obstacle that, once overcome, didn't detract from the overall positive experience. I would recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone in need of a quick replacement or a dependable backup device",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/MM9YD16SAFDGUZF,3NBF5ZZMX044SV5,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.S5MDHNUE4293GOT,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2025",True,,V07EPKVPM4,False

If you're in the market for a smartphone that seamlessly marries cutting-edge technology with sleek design, look no further than the Apple iPhone 11. As a devoted Apple enthusiast, I recently upgraded to this model, and I must say, it's exceeded my already high expectations.

Let's start with the design. The iPhone 11 boasts a stunning 6.1-inch Liquid Retina HD display that truly brings everything to life, from vibrant photos to immersive gaming experiences. The build quality is impeccable, with a robust aerospace-grade aluminum and glass construction that feels premium in the hand. The matte finish on the back not only looks sophisticated but also minimizes fingerprints, which is a practical touch.

Performance-wise, the iPhone 11 is a powerhouse. The A13 Bionic chip ensures lightning-fast responsiveness, whether you're multitasking between apps, editing videos on the go, or playing graphics-intensive games. This phone handles it all effortlessly. Plus, with iOS, you get the smoothest, most intuitive user experience in the smartphone world. Updates are timely, and the ecosystem seamlessly integrates with other Apple devices if you're part of the ecosystem.

Now, let's talk about the camera setup‚Äîa standout feature of the iPhone 11. The dual-camera system (12MP Ultra Wide and Wide cameras) captures stunning photos with impressive detail and color accuracy. Night mode is a game-changer, allowing you to take beautifully illuminated shots even in low-light conditions. The ability to shoot 4K videos at 60fps with extended dynamic range further showcases the iPhone 11's imaging prowess.

Battery life has been another pleasant surprise. The iPhone 11 easily lasts me through a full day of heavy use, thanks to optimizations in hardware and software. Fast charging support means I can quickly top up when needed, which is incredibly convenient.

As for connectivity, having the iPhone 11 unlocked gives me the flexibility to switch between carriers without any hassle. It supports 4G LTE and the latest Wi-Fi standards, ensuring a stable and speedy connection wherever I go.

In terms of value, the iPhone 11 hits the sweet spot. It offers flagship-level performance and features without the premium price tag of the Pro models. The 64GB storage variant provides ample space for apps, photos, and videos, but you can always opt for higher capacities if needed.

In conclusion, the Apple iPhone 11 is a triumph of design, performance, and value. Whether you're an Apple aficionado or simply looking for a top-tier smartphone experience, this device delivers on all fronts. It's reliable, versatile, and beautifully crafted‚Äîa true testament to Apple's commitment to innovation. I wholeheartedly recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone seeking a dependable and feature-rich mobile companion.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/6VBVD6RF41H6SOX,V9O6ZG5REMBS0B9,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.WX47TFNKGVI5ZQO,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on May 01, 2025",False,,VC0BFJSANX,False

It even had a (perfect) screen protector.  It was unlocked, easy to set up, and seems to run flawlessly.  The battery reserve so far is okay, although iPhone Settings claim it is an aftermarket replacement, and cannot tell me anything about battery health.  Battery issues ae commonly reported with used phones, but mine seems fine.

A couple of minor issues.  While the edge scratches were not functional, they were borderline for condition rated as ""excellent.""  Also, when ordering, play the extra $5 for FedEx or UPS delivery.  Ours came USPS and arrived unexpected early.  It was left on the top of our mailbox, but I was able to get it before heading off for a short trip.

TXCQQ9DX3XCXE0E,Not as described,"My iPhone 6 died and was only iOS 10 so it was time to get a new phone. After much deliberation I decided to buy the Apple iPhone 11, US Version, 128GB, Green - Unlocked (Renewed) and couldn't be happier. It looks brand new, literally not one scuff mark, the battery was at 82% life but for $329.00 I got the phone, a charger (cord and block) and a clear protective case with iOS 16 installed. Way cheaper than buying new. I also liked that it's not a huge phone, 6.1 inches.

I was concerned as my old phone completely died so I wasn't sure how to get Apple ID and all on the new phone as I don't have a landline or other phone. I googled and learned to just select lost password at the Apple ID prompt, it allowed me to reset my Apple password by asking for my old phone's passcode to open.  The sim card transfer was a piece of cake too for this non techy.  I love all the new things the iPhone 11 can do, easier deleting some things, the camera is better and wide lens, more emojis for texting, etc. I haven't charged the phone at all since 6:00 AM this morning and have been playing with it, updating apps, installing, etc. and the battery is still going strong from this morning.

When you get the phone it walks you through set up which just took a few minutes. Meaning it let me enter a new password, set up my language, time zone, etc. I believe it asked about font size, etc as well, it was all easy setup - nothing really stymied me which I was grateful for.

To put it through its paces, I emailed, texted, called, received calls, took photos, surfed the net, downloaded form the App store, etc and thus far no issues and at this point I don't anticipate any.

Spending the additional $$ for the latest and supposedly greatest iPhone isn't necessary for me - and I don't have to deal with ""new"" issues the latest phones sometimes have.

L5YK7YOQE6KBP2K,Very Short Battery Life,"Update:  I'm back with an update on our journey with the iPhone 11, and let me tell you, it's been quite the rollercoaster. Initially, I bought one for my daughter from a different seller, and it was, to put it mildly, a bit of a disaster. We had issues left and right ‚Äì Face ID not working, the phone overheating ‚Äì you name it. So, we returned it, feeling a bit skeptical about the whole refurbished scene.

But here's where the plot twists: we decided to give it another go, this time purchasing from the Amazon resellers store, specifically from a shop called Hybrid IT. And oh boy, what a difference! The iPhone we received this time around was nothing short of impeccable. It arrived with all the essentials ‚Äì a charger, a charging cable, and even a SIM card tool, all neatly packed. The phone itself? It could've fooled me for brand new.

This experience really hammered home the lesson that when it comes to refurbished goods, the ""who"" is just as crucial as the ""what."" The quality and condition of the product can vary wildly depending on the seller. Hybrid IT sent out an excellent product that exceeded our expectations in every way.

For those of you wary about diving into the world of refurbished electronics, let this be a testament. With the right seller, you can get your hands on a device that feels brand new, without the hefty price tag. We're over the moon with our iPhone 11, and I'll be sure to keep you all posted if anything changes. But for now, it seems like we've struck gold.

--------------------

I recently found myself in need of a quick replacement after my daughter accidentally broke her phone. The Apple iPhone 11, 64GB in black, seemed like a promising choice, primarily because we needed something that could be set up swiftly and would perform seamlessly as a backup.

Out of the box, the iPhone 11 felt like a brand-new device despite being a model released a few years back. The sleek black finish and the familiar design immediately caught my eye, reassuring me that this choice would not disappoint.

Setting up the iPhone 11 was mostly straightforward, especially with the unlocked version making it easy to switch from the old device. The transfer of data and settings from the previous iPhone was seamless, thanks to Apple's ecosystem. However, we hit a slight snag with the Face ID setup - it took a bit longer than expected to get it working properly. Despite this hiccup, once configured, Face ID has been working flawlessly.

The iPhone 11's performance has been impressive. The touch screen is responsive, making navigation and typing a breeze. Wi-Fi connectivity is fast, ensuring that browsing and app downloads are efficient. Although it's not the latest model, it handles everyday tasks with ease, from streaming video content to gaming, without any noticeable lag.

The main issue we encountered was the initial difficulty in setting up Face ID. It required a few attempts to configure, which was a minor inconvenience in an otherwise smooth setup process. After overcoming this challenge, the phone has been working perfectly.

Overall, this refurbished Apple iPhone 11 has proven to be a reliable and efficient backup phone. Its ease of setup, fast Wi-Fi, and responsive touch screen make it feel like a new device. The hiccup with Face ID setup was a small obstacle that, once overcome, didn't detract from the overall positive experience. I would recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone in need of a quick replacement or a dependable backup device",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/73JMLWLFA84TP3J,ST3594UJ4N9UKJB,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.FNAQFFS7LSXDEF6,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on March 03, 2025",True,,THPTPNLD3E,False

7Y69RONN0EZ6LO1,Could be better,"Update:  I'm back with an update on our journey with the iPhone 11, and let me tell you, it's been quite the rollercoaster. Initially, I bought one for my daughter from a different seller, and it was, to put it mildly, a bit of a disaster. We had issues left and right ‚Äì Face ID not working, the phone overheating ‚Äì you name it. So, we returned it, feeling a bit skeptical about the whole refurbished scene.

But here's where the plot twists: we decided to give it another go, this time purchasing from the Amazon resellers store, specifically from a shop called Hybrid IT. And oh boy, what a difference! The iPhone we received this time around was nothing short of impeccable. It arrived with all the essentials ‚Äì a charger, a charging cable, and even a SIM card tool, all neatly packed. The phone itself? It could've fooled me for brand new.

This experience really hammered home the lesson that when it comes to refurbished goods, the ""who"" is just as crucial as the ""what."" The quality and condition of the product can vary wildly depending on the seller. Hybrid IT sent out an excellent product that exceeded our expectations in every way.

For those of you wary about diving into the world of refurbished electronics, let this be a testament. With the right seller, you can get your hands on a device that feels brand new, without the hefty price tag. We're over the moon with our iPhone 11, and I'll be sure to keep you all posted if anything changes. But for now, it seems like we've struck gold.

--------------------

I recently found myself in need of a quick replacement after my daughter accidentally broke her phone. The Apple iPhone 11, 64GB in black, seemed like a promising choice, primarily because we needed something that could be set up swiftly and would perform seamlessly as a backup.

Out of the box, the iPhone 11 felt like a brand-new device despite being a model released a few years back. The sleek black finish and the familiar design immediately caught my eye, reassuring me that this choice would not disappoint.

Setting up the iPhone 11 was mostly straightforward, especially with the unlocked version making it easy to switch from the old device. The transfer of data and settings from the previous iPhone was seamless, thanks to Apple's ecosystem. However, we hit a slight snag with the Face ID setup - it took a bit longer than expected to get it working properly. Despite this hiccup, once configured, Face ID has been working flawlessly.

The iPhone 11's performance has been impressive. The touch screen is responsive, making navigation and typing a breeze. Wi-Fi connectivity is fast, ensuring that browsing and app downloads are efficient. Although it's not the latest model, it handles everyday tasks with ease, from streaming video content to gaming, without any noticeable lag.

The main issue we encountered was the initial difficulty in setting up Face ID. It required a few attempts to configure, which was a minor inconvenience in an otherwise smooth setup process. After overcoming this challenge, the phone has been working perfectly.

Overall, this refurbished Apple iPhone 11 has proven to be a reliable and efficient backup phone. Its ease of setup, fast Wi-Fi, and responsive touch screen make it feel like a new device. The hiccup with Face ID setup was a small obstacle that, once overcome, didn't detract from the overall positive experience. I would recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone in need of a quick replacement or a dependable backup device",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/014U3THZ6FSZ5PE,NEA3MPMNZT5ZEOV,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.HX2UPXSKYROUNUH,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025",True,,HJUHIHM3AD,True

3K9XKK657KNHOMA,"Nice phone, decent price","EDIT: Our daughter was given the phone a few days ago and it has been working great! There is one spot on the right side of the screen that is lighter than anywhere else. The only thing I can think of that would be causing it is something underneath is pressing up against the back side of a recently replaced screen. It's there regardless of what is showing on the screen. All colors and any image and you can still see a small white area that never gets color and then fades into the normal looking screen. It's so small, it's almost unnoticeable. I only put it in the review in case it is indeed something behind the screen and eventually causes issues. Currently, I am happy with the phone. Our daughter loves it and it appears to function perfectly!

Original Review: So far the phone is great! There doesn't appear to be any cosmetic issues at all. The phone turned on, loaded up and accepted my daughter's account login. Battery health is perfect, storage capacity is correct for my order. We won't actually be giving it to our daughter till her birthday in a couple weeks but preliminary inspection went well. Will update the review once we start actually using it but I am happy with the phone so far

0COY075CJS2SKZJ,Easy setup and Go,"The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.

[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]

My issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.
1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we‚Äôd be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.

2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website. Hope others have an easier time with setup.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/GMS3Q3KY8KIPIOZ,41YYVXPY17V6M35,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.1LJKQNEX8KCFP6Q,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2025",True,,D2R4XNMAR7,False

Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we‚Äôd be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.

2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website. Hope others have an easier time with setup.",1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROQ3F0GNVMJL2VV,S7CT8NPY74WTON2,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.2ZZ35CBADTXZB2V,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2025",False,,TNOE46380K,False

If you're in the market for a smartphone that seamlessly marries cutting-edge technology with sleek design, look no further than the Apple iPhone 11. As a devoted Apple enthusiast, I recently upgraded to this model, and I must say, it's exceeded my already high expectations.

Let's start with the design. The iPhone 11 boasts a stunning 6.1-inch Liquid Retina HD display that truly brings everything to life, from vibrant photos to immersive gaming experiences. The build quality is impeccable, with a robust aerospace-grade aluminum and glass construction that feels premium in the hand. The matte finish on the back not only looks sophisticated but also minimizes fingerprints, which is a practical touch.

Performance-wise, the iPhone 11 is a powerhouse. The A13 Bionic chip ensures lightning-fast responsiveness, whether you're multitasking between apps, editing videos on the go, or playing graphics-intensive games. This phone handles it all effortlessly. Plus, with iOS, you get the smoothest, most intuitive user experience in the smartphone world. Updates are timely, and the ecosystem seamlessly integrates with other Apple devices if you're part of the ecosystem.

Now, let's talk about the camera setup‚Äîa standout feature of the iPhone 11. The dual-camera system (12MP Ultra Wide and Wide cameras) captures stunning photos with impressive detail and color accuracy. Night mode is a game-changer, allowing you to take beautifully illuminated shots even in low-light conditions. The ability to shoot 4K videos at 60fps with extended dynamic range further showcases the iPhone 11's imaging prowess.

Battery life has been another pleasant surprise. The iPhone 11 easily lasts me through a full day of heavy use, thanks to optimizations in hardware and software. Fast charging support means I can quickly top up when needed, which is incredibly convenient.

As for connectivity, having the iPhone 11 unlocked gives me the flexibility to switch between carriers without any hassle. It supports 4G LTE and the latest Wi-Fi standards, ensuring a stable and speedy connection wherever I go.

In terms of value, the iPhone 11 hits the sweet spot. It offers flagship-level performance and features without the premium price tag of the Pro models. The 64GB storage variant provides ample space for apps, photos, and videos, but you can always opt for higher capacities if needed.

In conclusion, the Apple iPhone 11 is a triumph of design, performance, and value. Whether you're an Apple aficionado or simply looking for a top-tier smartphone experience, this device delivers on all fronts. It's reliable, versatile, and beautifully crafted‚Äîa true testament to Apple's commitment to innovation. I wholeheartedly recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone seeking a dependable and feature-rich mobile companion.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/1FJSCL2FJPV81FA,R65VV21X4VL5CF8,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.4BCM9UXOR26YT8G,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2025",True,,WEYHLFR0JH,False

OX0KXK4TC4SKSLP,Waste of money,"Update:  I'm back with an update on our journey with the iPhone 11, and let me tell you, it's been quite the rollercoaster. Initially, I bought one for my daughter from a different seller, and it was, to put it mildly, a bit of a disaster. We had issues left and right ‚Äì Face ID not working, the phone overheating ‚Äì you name it. So, we returned it, feeling a bit skeptical about the whole refurbished scene.

But here's where the plot twists: we decided to give it another go, this time purchasing from the Amazon resellers store, specifically from a shop called Hybrid IT. And oh boy, what a difference! The iPhone we received this time around was nothing short of impeccable. It arrived with all the essentials ‚Äì a charger, a charging cable, and even a SIM card tool, all neatly packed. The phone itself? It could've fooled me for brand new.

This experience really hammered home the lesson that when it comes to refurbished goods, the ""who"" is just as crucial as the ""what."" The quality and condition of the product can vary wildly depending on the seller. Hybrid IT sent out an excellent product that exceeded our expectations in every way.

For those of you wary about diving into the world of refurbished electronics, let this be a testament. With the right seller, you can get your hands on a device that feels brand new, without the hefty price tag. We're over the moon with our iPhone 11, and I'll be sure to keep you all posted if anything changes. But for now, it seems like we've struck gold.

--------------------

I recently found myself in need of a quick replacement after my daughter accidentally broke her phone. The Apple iPhone 11, 64GB in black, seemed like a promising choice, primarily because we needed something that could be set up swiftly and would perform seamlessly as a backup.

Out of the box, the iPhone 11 felt like a brand-new device despite being a model released a few years back. The sleek black finish and the familiar design immediately caught my eye, reassuring me that this choice would not disappoint.

Setting up the iPhone 11 was mostly straightforward, especially with the unlocked version making it easy to switch from the old device. The transfer of data and settings from the previous iPhone was seamless, thanks to Apple's ecosystem. However, we hit a slight snag with the Face ID setup - it took a bit longer than expected to get it working properly. Despite this hiccup, once configured, Face ID has been working flawlessly.

The iPhone 11's performance has been impressive. The touch screen is responsive, making navigation and typing a breeze. Wi-Fi connectivity is fast, ensuring that browsing and app downloads are efficient. Although it's not the latest model, it handles everyday tasks with ease, from streaming video content to gaming, without any noticeable lag.

The main issue we encountered was the initial difficulty in setting up Face ID. It required a few attempts to configure, which was a minor inconvenience in an otherwise smooth setup process. After overcoming this challenge, the phone has been working perfectly.

Overall, this refurbished Apple iPhone 11 has proven to be a reliable and efficient backup phone. Its ease of setup, fast Wi-Fi, and responsive touch screen make it feel like a new device. The hiccup with Face ID setup was a small obstacle that, once overcome, didn't detract from the overall positive experience. I would recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone in need of a quick replacement or a dependable backup device",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/VYTTGH7UEIIX4DD,H3CG7S1PVBBR7YE,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.YTRLM11OESB1OCX,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2025",True,,NTRY4FG9RD,False

9BFTWFXSDBSXHP4,iPhone 11,"The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.

[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]

My issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.
1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we‚Äôd be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.

2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website. Hope others have an easier time with setup.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/IJAO2D46O2DKOX3,7Y84XV447ZAAM0H,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.H3X9EK2QRDZ1WMX,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2025",False,,9XA4DSJQG6,False

W8P6QMGIGWA2LCK,Highly Recommend,"EDIT: Our daughter was given the phone a few days ago and it has been working great! There is one spot on the right side of the screen that is lighter than anywhere else. The only thing I can think of that would be causing it is something underneath is pressing up against the back side of a recently replaced screen. It's there regardless of what is showing on the screen. All colors and any image and you can still see a small white area that never gets color and then fades into the normal looking screen. It's so small, it's almost unnoticeable. I only put it in the review in case it is indeed something behind the screen and eventually causes issues. Currently, I am happy with the phone. Our daughter loves it and it appears to function perfectly!

Original Review: So far the phone is great! There doesn't appear to be any cosmetic issues at all. The phone turned on, loaded up and accepted my daughter's account login. Battery health is perfect, storage capacity is correct for my order. We won't actually be giving it to our daughter till her birthday in a couple weeks but preliminary inspection went well. Will update the review once we start actually using it but I am happy with the phone so far

9HYNP70IZQLRTW7,okay product,"I ordered this phone and received it in less than 4 days. I chose the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition out of all the renewed options. It is a lot bigger than I expected, but then again, I didn‚Äôt check the dimensions before I ordered it. The phone was packaged in a single bubble wrap sleeve. The box it came in contained a wall adapter and charging cable. The phone is almost flawless except for some scuff marks around the charging port. There are also some scuff marks around the volume up button.

I like that the color of the iPhone is a muted lavender color rather than a vibrant purple. The phone came with a screen protector already installed. I didn‚Äôt realize this until hours later while I was setting up the phone. The battery health is set at 90%, and this was written on the bubble wrap sleeve.

The one thing I will say about this phone is that it does lack a working left speaker on the bottom. The other reviews all seem to mention the speaker problem, and I hate to agree. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but I do wish the audio was up to par with the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition the phone is supposed to be in.

By the way, this phone was sold to me by Electronic Deals. They seem to have a slightly above average reputation. I love the fact it has 128gb of storage.

JUMRT3FKSE6R2MV,Phone,"EDIT: Our daughter was given the phone a few days ago and it has been working great! There is one spot on the right side of the screen that is lighter than anywhere else. The only thing I can think of that would be causing it is something underneath is pressing up against the back side of a recently replaced screen. It's there regardless of what is showing on the screen. All colors and any image and you can still see a small white area that never gets color and then fades into the normal looking screen. It's so small, it's almost unnoticeable. I only put it in the review in case it is indeed something behind the screen and eventually causes issues. Currently, I am happy with the phone. Our daughter loves it and it appears to function perfectly!

Original Review: So far the phone is great! There doesn't appear to be any cosmetic issues at all. The phone turned on, loaded up and accepted my daughter's account login. Battery health is perfect, storage capacity is correct for my order. We won't actually be giving it to our daughter till her birthday in a couple weeks but preliminary inspection went well. Will update the review once we start actually using it but I am happy with the phone so far

If you're in the market for a smartphone that seamlessly marries cutting-edge technology with sleek design, look no further than the Apple iPhone 11. As a devoted Apple enthusiast, I recently upgraded to this model, and I must say, it's exceeded my already high expectations.

Let's start with the design. The iPhone 11 boasts a stunning 6.1-inch Liquid Retina HD display that truly brings everything to life, from vibrant photos to immersive gaming experiences. The build quality is impeccable, with a robust aerospace-grade aluminum and glass construction that feels premium in the hand. The matte finish on the back not only looks sophisticated but also minimizes fingerprints, which is a practical touch.

Performance-wise, the iPhone 11 is a powerhouse. The A13 Bionic chip ensures lightning-fast responsiveness, whether you're multitasking between apps, editing videos on the go, or playing graphics-intensive games. This phone handles it all effortlessly. Plus, with iOS, you get the smoothest, most intuitive user experience in the smartphone world. Updates are timely, and the ecosystem seamlessly integrates with other Apple devices if you're part of the ecosystem.

Now, let's talk about the camera setup‚Äîa standout feature of the iPhone 11. The dual-camera system (12MP Ultra Wide and Wide cameras) captures stunning photos with impressive detail and color accuracy. Night mode is a game-changer, allowing you to take beautifully illuminated shots even in low-light conditions. The ability to shoot 4K videos at 60fps with extended dynamic range further showcases the iPhone 11's imaging prowess.

Battery life has been another pleasant surprise. The iPhone 11 easily lasts me through a full day of heavy use, thanks to optimizations in hardware and software. Fast charging support means I can quickly top up when needed, which is incredibly convenient.

As for connectivity, having the iPhone 11 unlocked gives me the flexibility to switch between carriers without any hassle. It supports 4G LTE and the latest Wi-Fi standards, ensuring a stable and speedy connection wherever I go.

In terms of value, the iPhone 11 hits the sweet spot. It offers flagship-level performance and features without the premium price tag of the Pro models. The 64GB storage variant provides ample space for apps, photos, and videos, but you can always opt for higher capacities if needed.

In conclusion, the Apple iPhone 11 is a triumph of design, performance, and value. Whether you're an Apple aficionado or simply looking for a top-tier smartphone experience, this device delivers on all fronts. It's reliable, versatile, and beautifully crafted‚Äîa true testament to Apple's commitment to innovation. I wholeheartedly recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone seeking a dependable and feature-rich mobile companion.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/QMBUAIDU7AKYP0B,ATN5C8EMUZYOTE5,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.ANIF7WCOV4SJDHM,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2025",False,,46A55ASR14,False

EBG8MA84UD32H6F,Good price for good phone,"I needed a new unlocked iPhone for my wife, since her 6 plus cannot run on any recent IOS iterations and is getting dropped by our mobile carrier.  Sooo, a used 11 seemed a logical choice, since her needs are minimal.  I have one as well and love it (no plans to upgrade).

After hunting around for about a week, I finally committed.  The phone arrived early and properly packaged.  There were some scratches on the edges, but only one of note.  It even had a (perfect) screen protector.  It was unlocked, easy to set up, and seems to run flawlessly.  The battery reserve so far is okay, although iPhone Settings claim it is an aftermarket replacement, and cannot tell me anything about battery health.  Battery issues ae commonly reported with used phones, but mine seems fine.

A couple of minor issues.  While the edge scratches were not functional, they were borderline for condition rated as ""excellent.""  Also, when ordering, play the extra $5 for FedEx or UPS delivery.  Ours came USPS and arrived unexpected early.  It was left on the top of our mailbox, but I was able to get it before heading off for a short trip.

To sum up, this was a good phone at a decent price (about$225 with 128 GB memory).  When my phone needs replacement, I would go with this seller again, but would not buy anything rated less than ""excellent condition"".",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/NJFBBUEHZ1DJJZE,QN3MEDKTJHEJJ0E,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.E78YCI7VAZ376SM,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2025",True,,IA3SWP7GC5,True

T3YEYE5SAQN0IB0,H,"I honestly can‚Äôt say enough amazing things about my experience buying a renewed iPhone 11 from this seller and dealing with their customer service! I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won‚Äôt be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.

My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn‚Äôt brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.

The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn‚Äôt love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn‚Äôt deliver it until 10pm! But that‚Äôs an issue with UPS, not the seller.

When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn‚Äôt pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn‚Äôt great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.

The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they‚Äôd overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn‚Äôt be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they‚Äôd overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn‚Äôt want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I‚Äôd reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I‚Äôd be sending it back with it on.

Life got hectic and I didn‚Äôt reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.

I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn‚Äôt ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn‚Äôt want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don‚Äôt have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.

When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn‚Äôt going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).

When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn‚Äôt a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It‚Äôs also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!

I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!

Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJLA21J4DCHWG57,HZBN1Q3YCIWQMDB,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.U4KWN5C7HV19X8N,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025",True,,VGM1RTKEAO,True

1YFLQ7NRGFRYSUE,Great product,"EDIT: Our daughter was given the phone a few days ago and it has been working great! There is one spot on the right side of the screen that is lighter than anywhere else. The only thing I can think of that would be causing it is something underneath is pressing up against the back side of a recently replaced screen. It's there regardless of what is showing on the screen. All colors and any image and you can still see a small white area that never gets color and then fades into the normal looking screen. It's so small, it's almost unnoticeable. I only put it in the review in case it is indeed something behind the screen and eventually causes issues. Currently, I am happy with the phone. Our daughter loves it and it appears to function perfectly!

Original Review: So far the phone is great! There doesn't appear to be any cosmetic issues at all. The phone turned on, loaded up and accepted my daughter's account login. Battery health is perfect, storage capacity is correct for my order. We won't actually be giving it to our daughter till her birthday in a couple weeks but preliminary inspection went well. Will update the review once we start actually using it but I am happy with the phone so far

ZIN61J0X9UGAG7P,Could be better,"The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.

[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]

My issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.
1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we‚Äôd be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.

2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website. Hope others have an easier time with setup.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ZC9IK1LSR8168IH,YXG1IZD3C8SBU92,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.6V5IVWN2959BID2,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2025",False,,G3854ZWKJZ,True

RG7G2BCLSNG2QDZ,Poor quality,"Update:  I'm back with an update on our journey with the iPhone 11, and let me tell you, it's been quite the rollercoaster. Initially, I bought one for my daughter from a different seller, and it was, to put it mildly, a bit of a disaster. We had issues left and right ‚Äì Face ID not working, the phone overheating ‚Äì you name it. So, we returned it, feeling a bit skeptical about the whole refurbished scene.

But here's where the plot twists: we decided to give it another go, this time purchasing from the Amazon resellers store, specifically from a shop called Hybrid IT. And oh boy, what a difference! The iPhone we received this time around was nothing short of impeccable. It arrived with all the essentials ‚Äì a charger, a charging cable, and even a SIM card tool, all neatly packed. The phone itself? It could've fooled me for brand new.

This experience really hammered home the lesson that when it comes to refurbished goods, the ""who"" is just as crucial as the ""what."" The quality and condition of the product can vary wildly depending on the seller. Hybrid IT sent out an excellent product that exceeded our expectations in every way.

For those of you wary about diving into the world of refurbished electronics, let this be a testament. With the right seller, you can get your hands on a device that feels brand new, without the hefty price tag. We're over the moon with our iPhone 11, and I'll be sure to keep you all posted if anything changes. But for now, it seems like we've struck gold.

--------------------

I recently found myself in need of a quick replacement after my daughter accidentally broke her phone. The Apple iPhone 11, 64GB in black, seemed like a promising choice, primarily because we needed something that could be set up swiftly and would perform seamlessly as a backup.

Out of the box, the iPhone 11 felt like a brand-new device despite being a model released a few years back. The sleek black finish and the familiar design immediately caught my eye, reassuring me that this choice would not disappoint.

Setting up the iPhone 11 was mostly straightforward, especially with the unlocked version making it easy to switch from the old device. The transfer of data and settings from the previous iPhone was seamless, thanks to Apple's ecosystem. However, we hit a slight snag with the Face ID setup - it took a bit longer than expected to get it working properly. Despite this hiccup, once configured, Face ID has been working flawlessly.

The iPhone 11's performance has been impressive. The touch screen is responsive, making navigation and typing a breeze. Wi-Fi connectivity is fast, ensuring that browsing and app downloads are efficient. Although it's not the latest model, it handles everyday tasks with ease, from streaming video content to gaming, without any noticeable lag.

The main issue we encountered was the initial difficulty in setting up Face ID. It required a few attempts to configure, which was a minor inconvenience in an otherwise smooth setup process. After overcoming this challenge, the phone has been working perfectly.

Overall, this refurbished Apple iPhone 11 has proven to be a reliable and efficient backup phone. Its ease of setup, fast Wi-Fi, and responsive touch screen make it feel like a new device. The hiccup with Face ID setup was a small obstacle that, once overcome, didn't detract from the overall positive experience. I would recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone in need of a quick replacement or a dependable backup device",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/VFUCN20X0VPU0BA,TL1PH5TRBDRCSFM,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.3ZDZYXOGWNSEXO9,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2025",False,,323GJHU99L,True

H0I5M8SBH7FMC3W,Exceeded expectations,"I ordered this phone and received it in less than 4 days. I chose the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition out of all the renewed options. It is a lot bigger than I expected, but then again, I didn‚Äôt check the dimensions before I ordered it. The phone was packaged in a single bubble wrap sleeve. The box it came in contained a wall adapter and charging cable. The phone is almost flawless except for some scuff marks around the charging port. There are also some scuff marks around the volume up button.

I like that the color of the iPhone is a muted lavender color rather than a vibrant purple. The phone came with a screen protector already installed. I didn‚Äôt realize this until hours later while I was setting up the phone. The battery health is set at 90%, and this was written on the bubble wrap sleeve.

The one thing I will say about this phone is that it does lack a working left speaker on the bottom. The other reviews all seem to mention the speaker problem, and I hate to agree. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but I do wish the audio was up to par with the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition the phone is supposed to be in.

By the way, this phone was sold to me by Electronic Deals. They seem to have a slightly above average reputation. I love the fact it has 128gb of storage. I upgraded from a refurbished iPhone 7, and I think I made a good decision! I like my new phone.

The camera is simply outstanding, especially for well-lit photos or portrait mode shots. The battery lasts a long time, and the operating system runs flawlessly. Plus, the design still looks modern and sleek, even though it‚Äôs not the newest model.

The best part was the value for the price. Compared to other stores, I found a deal on Amazon that was truly worth it. For what I paid, there‚Äôs no other phone that offers as much.

GX789DO437ROX4S,Waste of money,"I honestly can‚Äôt say enough amazing things about my experience buying a renewed iPhone 11 from this seller and dealing with their customer service! I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won‚Äôt be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.

My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn‚Äôt brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.

The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn‚Äôt love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn‚Äôt deliver it until 10pm! But that‚Äôs an issue with UPS, not the seller.

When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn‚Äôt pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn‚Äôt great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.

The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they‚Äôd overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn‚Äôt be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they‚Äôd overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn‚Äôt want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I‚Äôd reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I‚Äôd be sending it back with it on.

Life got hectic and I didn‚Äôt reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.

I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn‚Äôt ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn‚Äôt want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don‚Äôt have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.

When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn‚Äôt going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).

When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn‚Äôt a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It‚Äôs also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!

I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!

Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/INQAYX6UBADWXRM,HJF7SOE8IBCTS3P,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.9JKN3PPWZPN51PF,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2025",False,,PU3GY35PWV,True

QJ78AH4LP28AHVR,Not as described,"I needed a new unlocked iPhone for my wife, since her 6 plus cannot run on any recent IOS iterations and is getting dropped by our mobile carrier.  Sooo, a used 11 seemed a logical choice, since her needs are minimal.  I have one as well and love it (no plans to upgrade).

After hunting around for about a week, I finally committed.  The phone arrived early and properly packaged.  There were some scratches on the edges, but only one of note.  It even had a (perfect) screen protector.  It was unlocked, easy to set up, and seems to run flawlessly.  The battery reserve so far is okay, although iPhone Settings claim it is an aftermarket replacement, and cannot tell me anything about battery health.  Battery issues ae commonly reported with used phones, but mine seems fine.

A couple of minor issues.  While the edge scratches were not functional, they were borderline for condition rated as ""excellent.""  Also, when ordering, play the extra $5 for FedEx or UPS delivery.  Ours came USPS and arrived unexpected early.  It was left on the top of our mailbox, but I was able to get it before heading off for a short trip.

0CI25CETDJTRT6Y,Very happy love it,"I honestly can‚Äôt say enough amazing things about my experience buying a renewed iPhone 11 from this seller and dealing with their customer service! I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won‚Äôt be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.

My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn‚Äôt brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.

The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn‚Äôt love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn‚Äôt deliver it until 10pm! But that‚Äôs an issue with UPS, not the seller.

When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn‚Äôt pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn‚Äôt great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.

The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they‚Äôd overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn‚Äôt be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they‚Äôd overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn‚Äôt want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I‚Äôd reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I‚Äôd be sending it back with it on.

Life got hectic and I didn‚Äôt reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.

I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn‚Äôt ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn‚Äôt want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don‚Äôt have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.

When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn‚Äôt going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).

When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn‚Äôt a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It‚Äôs also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!

I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!

Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ERX7TBEZVDMY2ZO,FWL45PT2RUTVSG3,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.S7CBM7W4NHW3XL9,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on January 04, 2025",True,,GGYQ2RW3J2,False
ZB6J5U4NVHO6908,Just what I expected,"I was worried about ordering a refurbished item, but this phone came in mint condition, looking at it you would never have thought that it was refurbished. I‚Äôve been using a pixel since 2018 so as far as I know, the phone is functioning as it should it taken a while to get used to Apple again. Put the functions charging and connectivity all seem where it should be at. I happen to have dropped the phone while it was out of its case and the whole front cracked. I raise my hands to the sky because my last phone fell into the bathtub but soon realize that the real screen and crack it was the screen cover that the company had put on the phone before it arrived to me. So all is well in my world as I carefully unpeeled the broken screen protector, and carefully put the phone in its new case I would order from them again because my experience has been nothing but hassle free. I can worry about which buttons press and how to use Apple Pay and not have to worry about the technical issues that could go awry, but haven‚Äôt. Ty. I‚Äôve ordered refurbished things that have wonky GPS shadows on the screen keyboard that didn‚Äôt work, but everything so far is in fine condition. If anything drastic happens that‚Äôs out of place.

Put the functions charging and connectivity all seem where it should be at. I happen to have dropped the phone while it was out of its case and the whole front cracked. I raise my hands to the sky because my last phone fell into the bathtub but soon realize that the real screen and crack it was the screen cover that the company had put on the phone before it arrived to me. So all is well in my world as I carefully unpeeled the broken screen protector, and carefully put the phone in its new case I would order from them again because my experience has been nothing but hassle free. I can worry about which buttons press and how to use Apple Pay and not have to worry about the technical issues that could go awry, but haven‚Äôt. Ty.

I purchased this with the trust that the battery would be tested and meet the stated minimum. Sadly, this falls short. If you‚Äôre promising 80%, please make sure that‚Äôs what customers actually receive.

332FA0JQZUFELF4,H,"I ordered this phone and received it in less than 4 days. I chose the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition out of all the renewed options. It is a lot bigger than I expected, but then again, I didn‚Äôt check the dimensions before I ordered it. The phone was packaged in a single bubble wrap sleeve. The box it came in contained a wall adapter and charging cable. The phone is almost flawless except for some scuff marks around the charging port. There are also some scuff marks around the volume up button.

I like that the color of the iPhone is a muted lavender color rather than a vibrant purple. The phone came with a screen protector already installed. I didn‚Äôt realize this until hours later while I was setting up the phone. The battery health is set at 90%, and this was written on the bubble wrap sleeve.

The one thing I will say about this phone is that it does lack a working left speaker on the bottom. The other reviews all seem to mention the speaker problem, and I hate to agree. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but I do wish the audio was up to par with the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition the phone is supposed to be in.

By the way, this phone was sold to me by Electronic Deals. They seem to have a slightly above average reputation. I love the fact it has 128gb of storage.

VKKQ7ZV37RFUWRC,Awesome looks brand new,"The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.

[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]

My issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.
1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we‚Äôd be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.

2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website.

61S67PV5A61030T,Battery Life Low,"Although the phone is in mint condition, I‚Äôm talking no cracks or scratches. No visible damage. Runs smoothly, I  transferred my other phone over it was a smooth process, although it did fail one time. Overall, runs nice and doesn‚Äôt give me trouble. My only concern was the battery life, it came at 76%. Its been almost two weeks since my purchase, no complaints except that. I switched my sim card over from my other phone too, no problems or concerns there, it shows up as unlocked. I love the Iphone 11 and it was a deal to get an extra 128gb of storage too. I just hate that I‚Äôll have to get the battery replaced, didn‚Äôt plan on investing in this phone so soon. Because when I charge it when it gets to a low percentage, it kind of fluctuates before the percentage starts to go up and thats a little annoying. As you can see tho, it can get to full charge no issue except that.

18AGDNA4C9K4FW7,Waste of money,"My iPhone 6 died and was only iOS 10 so it was time to get a new phone. After much deliberation I decided to buy the Apple iPhone 11, US Version, 128GB, Green - Unlocked (Renewed) and couldn't be happier. It looks brand new, literally not one scuff mark, the battery was at 82% life but for $329.00 I got the phone, a charger (cord and block) and a clear protective case with iOS 16 installed. Way cheaper than buying new. I also liked that it's not a huge phone, 6.1 inches.

I was concerned as my old phone completely died so I wasn't sure how to get Apple ID and all on the new phone as I don't have a landline or other phone. I googled and learned to just select lost password at the Apple ID prompt, it allowed me to reset my Apple password by asking for my old phone's passcode to open.  The sim card transfer was a piece of cake too for this non techy.  I love all the new things the iPhone 11 can do, easier deleting some things, the camera is better and wide lens, more emojis for texting, etc. I haven't charged the phone at all since 6:00 AM this morning and have been playing with it, updating apps, installing, etc. and the battery is still going strong from this morning.

When you get the phone it walks you through set up which just took a few minutes. Meaning it let me enter a new password, set up my language, time zone, etc. I believe it asked about font size, etc as well, it was all easy setup - nothing really stymied me which I was grateful for.

To put it through its paces, I emailed, texted, called, received calls, took photos, surfed the net, downloaded form the App store, etc and thus far no issues and at this point I don't anticipate any.

Spending the additional $$ for the latest and supposedly greatest iPhone isn't necessary for me - and I don't have to deal with ""new"" issues the latest phones sometimes have.  In summary, I would definitely buy unlocked and renewed again.",2,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG6SB8D77855QLM,TW0C0FNE2M97AKJ,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.QNTR7VCN80G6FNW,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2025",False,,IM2V581L34,False
Z1E0K8KGIEKY79M,No scratches,"The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.

[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]

My issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.
1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we‚Äôd be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.

2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website. Hope others have an easier time with setup.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/8QV1N68D0MJL1PY,R12IX11YYIAUH1Y,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.10YDGT5EWH68GO4,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2025",True,,97T10J9EOJ,True

UOGW9JDO14KQQ2K,Waste of money,"My iPhone 6 died and was only iOS 10 so it was time to get a new phone. After much deliberation I decided to buy the Apple iPhone 11, US Version, 128GB, Green - Unlocked (Renewed) and couldn't be happier. It looks brand new, literally not one scuff mark, the battery was at 82% life but for $329.00 I got the phone, a charger (cord and block) and a clear protective case with iOS 16 installed. Way cheaper than buying new. I also liked that it's not a huge phone, 6.1 inches.

I was concerned as my old phone completely died so I wasn't sure how to get Apple ID and all on the new phone as I don't have a landline or other phone. I googled and learned to just select lost password at the Apple ID prompt, it allowed me to reset my Apple password by asking for my old phone's passcode to open.  The sim card transfer was a piece of cake too for this non techy.  I love all the new things the iPhone 11 can do, easier deleting some things, the camera is better and wide lens, more emojis for texting, etc. I haven't charged the phone at all since 6:00 AM this morning and have been playing with it, updating apps, installing, etc. and the battery is still going strong from this morning.

When you get the phone it walks you through set up which just took a few minutes. Meaning it let me enter a new password, set up my language, time zone, etc. I believe it asked about font size, etc as well, it was all easy setup - nothing really stymied me which I was grateful for.

To put it through its paces, I emailed, texted, called, received calls, took photos, surfed the net, downloaded form the App store, etc and thus far no issues and at this point I don't anticipate any.

Spending the additional $$ for the latest and supposedly greatest iPhone isn't necessary for me - and I don't have to deal with ""new"" issues the latest phones sometimes have.

I‚Äôve been using a pixel since 2018 so as far as I know, the phone is functioning as it should it taken a while to get used to Apple again. Put the functions charging and connectivity all seem where it should be at. I happen to have dropped the phone while it was out of its case and the whole front cracked. I raise my hands to the sky because my last phone fell into the bathtub but soon realize that the real screen and crack it was the screen cover that the company had put on the phone before it arrived to me. So all is well in my world as I carefully unpeeled the broken screen protector, and carefully put the phone in its new case I would order from them again because my experience has been nothing but hassle free. I can worry about which buttons press and how to use Apple Pay and not have to worry about the technical issues that could go awry, but haven‚Äôt. Ty.

N17V9WHKAQG6BNA,76% battery capacity,"I honestly can‚Äôt say enough amazing things about my experience buying a renewed iPhone 11 from this seller and dealing with their customer service! I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won‚Äôt be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.

My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn‚Äôt brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.

The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn‚Äôt love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn‚Äôt deliver it until 10pm! But that‚Äôs an issue with UPS, not the seller.

When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn‚Äôt pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn‚Äôt great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.

The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they‚Äôd overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn‚Äôt be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they‚Äôd overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn‚Äôt want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I‚Äôd reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I‚Äôd be sending it back with it on.

Life got hectic and I didn‚Äôt reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.

I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn‚Äôt ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn‚Äôt want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don‚Äôt have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.

When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn‚Äôt going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).

When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn‚Äôt a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It‚Äôs also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!

I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!

Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/OYUEFFZ8017K2W2,12S94FZSR57OBCF,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.GZ8CHOHIXU99ISQ,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2025",False,,TCB4S67BN1,False

61QKCPJ0FSCN24H,Very Short Battery Life,"I needed a new unlocked iPhone for my wife, since her 6 plus cannot run on any recent IOS iterations and is getting dropped by our mobile carrier.  Sooo, a used 11 seemed a logical choice, since her needs are minimal.  I have one as well and love it (no plans to upgrade).

After hunting around for about a week, I finally committed.  The phone arrived early and properly packaged.  There were some scratches on the edges, but only one of note.  It even had a (perfect) screen protector.  It was unlocked, easy to set up, and seems to run flawlessly.  The battery reserve so far is okay, although iPhone Settings claim it is an aftermarket replacement, and cannot tell me anything about battery health.  Battery issues ae commonly reported with used phones, but mine seems fine.

A couple of minor issues.  While the edge scratches were not functional, they were borderline for condition rated as ""excellent.""  Also, when ordering, play the extra $5 for FedEx or UPS delivery.  Ours came USPS and arrived unexpected early.  It was left on the top of our mailbox, but I was able to get it before heading off for a short trip.

To sum up, this was a good phone at a decent price (about$225 with 128 GB memory).  When my phone needs replacement, I would go with this seller again, but would not buy anything rated less than ""excellent condition"".",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/550SFLMZPYZY6LC,S9PQU66RM1YBNYX,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.XV2R5JIXEU4GQIK,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on January 02, 2025",False,,548ZR91VWA,False

2IXC3K1U56MTRNU,Love it!,"EDIT: Our daughter was given the phone a few days ago and it has been working great! There is one spot on the right side of the screen that is lighter than anywhere else. The only thing I can think of that would be causing it is something underneath is pressing up against the back side of a recently replaced screen. It's there regardless of what is showing on the screen. All colors and any image and you can still see a small white area that never gets color and then fades into the normal looking screen. It's so small, it's almost unnoticeable. I only put it in the review in case it is indeed something behind the screen and eventually causes issues. Currently, I am happy with the phone. Our daughter loves it and it appears to function perfectly!

Original Review: So far the phone is great! There doesn't appear to be any cosmetic issues at all. The phone turned on, loaded up and accepted my daughter's account login. Battery health is perfect, storage capacity is correct for my order. We won't actually be giving it to our daughter till her birthday in a couple weeks but preliminary inspection went well. Will update the review once we start actually using it but I am happy with the phone so far

2XHUBHHUGXFBR53,It's okay,"I ordered this phone and received it in less than 4 days. I chose the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition out of all the renewed options. It is a lot bigger than I expected, but then again, I didn‚Äôt check the dimensions before I ordered it. The phone was packaged in a single bubble wrap sleeve. The box it came in contained a wall adapter and charging cable. The phone is almost flawless except for some scuff marks around the charging port. There are also some scuff marks around the volume up button.

I like that the color of the iPhone is a muted lavender color rather than a vibrant purple. The phone came with a screen protector already installed. I didn‚Äôt realize this until hours later while I was setting up the phone. The battery health is set at 90%, and this was written on the bubble wrap sleeve.

The one thing I will say about this phone is that it does lack a working left speaker on the bottom. The other reviews all seem to mention the speaker problem, and I hate to agree. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but I do wish the audio was up to par with the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition the phone is supposed to be in.

By the way, this phone was sold to me by Electronic Deals. They seem to have a slightly above average reputation. I love the fact it has 128gb of storage.

Runs smoothly, I  transferred my other phone over it was a smooth process, although it did fail one time. Overall, runs nice and doesn‚Äôt give me trouble. My only concern was the battery life, it came at 76%. Its been almost two weeks since my purchase, no complaints except that. I switched my sim card over from my other phone too, no problems or concerns there, it shows up as unlocked. I love the Iphone 11 and it was a deal to get an extra 128gb of storage too. I just hate that I‚Äôll have to get the battery replaced, didn‚Äôt plan on investing in this phone so soon. Because when I charge it when it gets to a low percentage, it kind of fluctuates before the percentage starts to go up and thats a little annoying.

W512O3CHJLNTXJV,I do recommend,"My iPhone 6 died and was only iOS 10 so it was time to get a new phone. After much deliberation I decided to buy the Apple iPhone 11, US Version, 128GB, Green - Unlocked (Renewed) and couldn't be happier. It looks brand new, literally not one scuff mark, the battery was at 82% life but for $329.00 I got the phone, a charger (cord and block) and a clear protective case with iOS 16 installed. Way cheaper than buying new. I also liked that it's not a huge phone, 6.1 inches.

I was concerned as my old phone completely died so I wasn't sure how to get Apple ID and all on the new phone as I don't have a landline or other phone. I googled and learned to just select lost password at the Apple ID prompt, it allowed me to reset my Apple password by asking for my old phone's passcode to open.  The sim card transfer was a piece of cake too for this non techy.  I love all the new things the iPhone 11 can do, easier deleting some things, the camera is better and wide lens, more emojis for texting, etc. I haven't charged the phone at all since 6:00 AM this morning and have been playing with it, updating apps, installing, etc. and the battery is still going strong from this morning.

When you get the phone it walks you through set up which just took a few minutes. Meaning it let me enter a new password, set up my language, time zone, etc. I believe it asked about font size, etc as well, it was all easy setup - nothing really stymied me which I was grateful for.

To put it through its paces, I emailed, texted, called, received calls, took photos, surfed the net, downloaded form the App store, etc and thus far no issues and at this point I don't anticipate any.

Spending the additional $$ for the latest and supposedly greatest iPhone isn't necessary for me - and I don't have to deal with ""new"" issues the latest phones sometimes have.  In summary, I would definitely buy unlocked and renewed again.",2,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/LCQGTFLYBGAS8VZ,I3NAUSZV9065K0Q,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.JT8YI3WEX6BDCT1,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on April 01, 2025",False,,G6V4AUJZHF,False

I‚Äôve been using a pixel since 2018 so as far as I know, the phone is functioning as it should it taken a while to get used to Apple again. Put the functions charging and connectivity all seem where it should be at. I happen to have dropped the phone while it was out of its case and the whole front cracked. I raise my hands to the sky because my last phone fell into the bathtub but soon realize that the real screen and crack it was the screen cover that the company had put on the phone before it arrived to me. So all is well in my world as I carefully unpeeled the broken screen protector, and carefully put the phone in its new case I would order from them again because my experience has been nothing but hassle free. I can worry about which buttons press and how to use Apple Pay and not have to worry about the technical issues that could go awry, but haven‚Äôt. Ty. I‚Äôve ordered refurbished things that have wonky GPS shadows on the screen keyboard that didn‚Äôt work, but everything so far is in fine condition. If anything drastic happens that‚Äôs out of place.

PYRRR17KMEB3L4B,Apple iPhone 11 Review: A Reliable Backup That Feels Like New,"EDIT: Our daughter was given the phone a few days ago and it has been working great! There is one spot on the right side of the screen that is lighter than anywhere else. The only thing I can think of that would be causing it is something underneath is pressing up against the back side of a recently replaced screen. It's there regardless of what is showing on the screen. All colors and any image and you can still see a small white area that never gets color and then fades into the normal looking screen. It's so small, it's almost unnoticeable. I only put it in the review in case it is indeed something behind the screen and eventually causes issues. Currently, I am happy with the phone. Our daughter loves it and it appears to function perfectly!

Original Review: So far the phone is great! There doesn't appear to be any cosmetic issues at all. The phone turned on, loaded up and accepted my daughter's account login. Battery health is perfect, storage capacity is correct for my order. We won't actually be giving it to our daughter till her birthday in a couple weeks but preliminary inspection went well. Will update the review once we start actually using it but I am happy with the phone so far

0QG213A95HHD7QY,Solid Device,"My iPhone 6 died and was only iOS 10 so it was time to get a new phone. After much deliberation I decided to buy the Apple iPhone 11, US Version, 128GB, Green - Unlocked (Renewed) and couldn't be happier. It looks brand new, literally not one scuff mark, the battery was at 82% life but for $329.00 I got the phone, a charger (cord and block) and a clear protective case with iOS 16 installed. Way cheaper than buying new. I also liked that it's not a huge phone, 6.1 inches.

I was concerned as my old phone completely died so I wasn't sure how to get Apple ID and all on the new phone as I don't have a landline or other phone. I googled and learned to just select lost password at the Apple ID prompt, it allowed me to reset my Apple password by asking for my old phone's passcode to open.  The sim card transfer was a piece of cake too for this non techy.  I love all the new things the iPhone 11 can do, easier deleting some things, the camera is better and wide lens, more emojis for texting, etc. I haven't charged the phone at all since 6:00 AM this morning and have been playing with it, updating apps, installing, etc. and the battery is still going strong from this morning.

When you get the phone it walks you through set up which just took a few minutes. Meaning it let me enter a new password, set up my language, time zone, etc. I believe it asked about font size, etc as well, it was all easy setup - nothing really stymied me which I was grateful for.

To put it through its paces, I emailed, texted, called, received calls, took photos, surfed the net, downloaded form the App store, etc and thus far no issues and at this point I don't anticipate any.

Spending the additional $$ for the latest and supposedly greatest iPhone isn't necessary for me - and I don't have to deal with ""new"" issues the latest phones sometimes have.  In summary, I would definitely buy unlocked and renewed again.",1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/JM34Z9HX9HENA3R,VOVKX00EWZK54V9,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.WPAVDLCR3WG1NZD,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2025",True,,SYQWM1WV6M,True

If you're in the market for a smartphone that seamlessly marries cutting-edge technology with sleek design, look no further than the Apple iPhone 11. As a devoted Apple enthusiast, I recently upgraded to this model, and I must say, it's exceeded my already high expectations.

Let's start with the design. The iPhone 11 boasts a stunning 6.1-inch Liquid Retina HD display that truly brings everything to life, from vibrant photos to immersive gaming experiences. The build quality is impeccable, with a robust aerospace-grade aluminum and glass construction that feels premium in the hand. The matte finish on the back not only looks sophisticated but also minimizes fingerprints, which is a practical touch.

Performance-wise, the iPhone 11 is a powerhouse. The A13 Bionic chip ensures lightning-fast responsiveness, whether you're multitasking between apps, editing videos on the go, or playing graphics-intensive games. This phone handles it all effortlessly. Plus, with iOS, you get the smoothest, most intuitive user experience in the smartphone world. Updates are timely, and the ecosystem seamlessly integrates with other Apple devices if you're part of the ecosystem.

Now, let's talk about the camera setup‚Äîa standout feature of the iPhone 11. The dual-camera system (12MP Ultra Wide and Wide cameras) captures stunning photos with impressive detail and color accuracy. Night mode is a game-changer, allowing you to take beautifully illuminated shots even in low-light conditions. The ability to shoot 4K videos at 60fps with extended dynamic range further showcases the iPhone 11's imaging prowess.

Battery life has been another pleasant surprise. The iPhone 11 easily lasts me through a full day of heavy use, thanks to optimizations in hardware and software. Fast charging support means I can quickly top up when needed, which is incredibly convenient.

As for connectivity, having the iPhone 11 unlocked gives me the flexibility to switch between carriers without any hassle. It supports 4G LTE and the latest Wi-Fi standards, ensuring a stable and speedy connection wherever I go.

In terms of value, the iPhone 11 hits the sweet spot. It offers flagship-level performance and features without the premium price tag of the Pro models. The 64GB storage variant provides ample space for apps, photos, and videos, but you can always opt for higher capacities if needed.

In conclusion, the Apple iPhone 11 is a triumph of design, performance, and value. Whether you're an Apple aficionado or simply looking for a top-tier smartphone experience, this device delivers on all fronts. It's reliable, versatile, and beautifully crafted‚Äîa true testament to Apple's commitment to innovation. I wholeheartedly recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone seeking a dependable and feature-rich mobile companion.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/46QWLF6DP4TKI4V,450RHYZZ70XYG8H,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.9WMTF70T4B6NDV9,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2025",True,,CCY9DGBVVD,True

YIBKR28EYVKQ12B,Not as described,"I ordered this phone and received it in less than 4 days. I chose the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition out of all the renewed options. It is a lot bigger than I expected, but then again, I didn‚Äôt check the dimensions before I ordered it. The phone was packaged in a single bubble wrap sleeve. The box it came in contained a wall adapter and charging cable. The phone is almost flawless except for some scuff marks around the charging port. There are also some scuff marks around the volume up button.

I like that the color of the iPhone is a muted lavender color rather than a vibrant purple. The phone came with a screen protector already installed. I didn‚Äôt realize this until hours later while I was setting up the phone. The battery health is set at 90%, and this was written on the bubble wrap sleeve.

The one thing I will say about this phone is that it does lack a working left speaker on the bottom. The other reviews all seem to mention the speaker problem, and I hate to agree. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but I do wish the audio was up to par with the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition the phone is supposed to be in.

By the way, this phone was sold to me by Electronic Deals. They seem to have a slightly above average reputation. I love the fact it has 128gb of storage.

CS5P4VE2Q8G27ZI,I phone 11 refurbished excellent condition,"I honestly can‚Äôt say enough amazing things about my experience buying a renewed iPhone 11 from this seller and dealing with their customer service! I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won‚Äôt be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.

My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn‚Äôt brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.

The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn‚Äôt love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn‚Äôt deliver it until 10pm! But that‚Äôs an issue with UPS, not the seller.

When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn‚Äôt pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn‚Äôt great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.

The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they‚Äôd overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn‚Äôt be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they‚Äôd overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn‚Äôt want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I‚Äôd reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I‚Äôd be sending it back with it on.

Life got hectic and I didn‚Äôt reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.

I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn‚Äôt ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn‚Äôt want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don‚Äôt have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.

When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn‚Äôt going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).

When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn‚Äôt a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It‚Äôs also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!

I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!

Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/WMJMLVWZGHMS7B6,PS770BAHLJI7P7E,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.NJG7FVIV2B2V965,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2025",True,,HRHX26MTDM,True

L0XV81KXUZSOQKN,Love it!,"My iPhone 6 died and was only iOS 10 so it was time to get a new phone. After much deliberation I decided to buy the Apple iPhone 11, US Version, 128GB, Green - Unlocked (Renewed) and couldn't be happier. It looks brand new, literally not one scuff mark, the battery was at 82% life but for $329.00 I got the phone, a charger (cord and block) and a clear protective case with iOS 16 installed. Way cheaper than buying new. I also liked that it's not a huge phone, 6.1 inches.

I was concerned as my old phone completely died so I wasn't sure how to get Apple ID and all on the new phone as I don't have a landline or other phone. I googled and learned to just select lost password at the Apple ID prompt, it allowed me to reset my Apple password by asking for my old phone's passcode to open.  The sim card transfer was a piece of cake too for this non techy.  I love all the new things the iPhone 11 can do, easier deleting some things, the camera is better and wide lens, more emojis for texting, etc. I haven't charged the phone at all since 6:00 AM this morning and have been playing with it, updating apps, installing, etc. and the battery is still going strong from this morning.

When you get the phone it walks you through set up which just took a few minutes. Meaning it let me enter a new password, set up my language, time zone, etc. I believe it asked about font size, etc as well, it was all easy setup - nothing really stymied me which I was grateful for.

To put it through its paces, I emailed, texted, called, received calls, took photos, surfed the net, downloaded form the App store, etc and thus far no issues and at this point I don't anticipate any.

Spending the additional $$ for the latest and supposedly greatest iPhone isn't necessary for me - and I don't have to deal with ""new"" issues the latest phones sometimes have.  In summary, I would definitely buy unlocked and renewed again.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/AOLX528HYPUOWGQ,TXTF6GATAA9L9XY,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.UTBRTL3TEJGILD9,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2025",True,,Y7D8WMMFQS,True

W0TJQ8Z3JJUFG6H,Love it!,"The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.

[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]

My issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.
1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we‚Äôd be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.

2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website. Hope others have an easier time with setup.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/DKDWFBL1HGI3GGN,MWTBD3G1V8EZNZH,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.9GCHG36HW9VO86F,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2025",True,,DJR3ZC0KL2,True
4V7FD4009Z8VUYA,.,"EDIT: Our daughter was given the phone a few days ago and it has been working great! There is one spot on the right side of the screen that is lighter than anywhere else. The only thing I can think of that would be causing it is something underneath is pressing up against the back side of a recently replaced screen. It's there regardless of what is showing on the screen. All colors and any image and you can still see a small white area that never gets color and then fades into the normal looking screen. It's so small, it's almost unnoticeable. I only put it in the review in case it is indeed something behind the screen and eventually causes issues. Currently, I am happy with the phone. Our daughter loves it and it appears to function perfectly!

Original Review: So far the phone is great! There doesn't appear to be any cosmetic issues at all. The phone turned on, loaded up and accepted my daughter's account login. Battery health is perfect, storage capacity is correct for my order. We won't actually be giving it to our daughter till her birthday in a couple weeks but preliminary inspection went well. Will update the review once we start actually using it but I am happy with the phone so far

A0G8LPM3IYZZD4X,Solid Device,"I needed a new unlocked iPhone for my wife, since her 6 plus cannot run on any recent IOS iterations and is getting dropped by our mobile carrier.  Sooo, a used 11 seemed a logical choice, since her needs are minimal.  I have one as well and love it (no plans to upgrade).

After hunting around for about a week, I finally committed.  The phone arrived early and properly packaged.  There were some scratches on the edges, but only one of note.  It even had a (perfect) screen protector.  It was unlocked, easy to set up, and seems to run flawlessly.  The battery reserve so far is okay, although iPhone Settings claim it is an aftermarket replacement, and cannot tell me anything about battery health.  Battery issues ae commonly reported with used phones, but mine seems fine.

A couple of minor issues.  While the edge scratches were not functional, they were borderline for condition rated as ""excellent.""  Also, when ordering, play the extra $5 for FedEx or UPS delivery.  Ours came USPS and arrived unexpected early.  It was left on the top of our mailbox, but I was able to get it before heading off for a short trip.

To sum up, this was a good phone at a decent price (about$225 with 128 GB memory).

I originally bought one of these refurbished iPhone 11s (64GB, green, unlocked) on Amazon and was seriously impressed. It looked brand new ‚Äî not a single scratch ‚Äî and everything worked perfectly right out of the box. I ended up gifting that first one to my daughter, and she absolutely loves it. No issues at all.

Because the first one was such a great buy, I decided to order another and gift it to my niece. Same experience again ‚Äî flawless condition, beautifully packaged, and fully functional. No defects, no problems, just a great phone at a great price.

N0BSDYDSNZ1WQ4O,It's okay,"My iPhone 6 died and was only iOS 10 so it was time to get a new phone. After much deliberation I decided to buy the Apple iPhone 11, US Version, 128GB, Green - Unlocked (Renewed) and couldn't be happier. It looks brand new, literally not one scuff mark, the battery was at 82% life but for $329.00 I got the phone, a charger (cord and block) and a clear protective case with iOS 16 installed. Way cheaper than buying new. I also liked that it's not a huge phone, 6.1 inches.

I was concerned as my old phone completely died so I wasn't sure how to get Apple ID and all on the new phone as I don't have a landline or other phone. I googled and learned to just select lost password at the Apple ID prompt, it allowed me to reset my Apple password by asking for my old phone's passcode to open.  The sim card transfer was a piece of cake too for this non techy.  I love all the new things the iPhone 11 can do, easier deleting some things, the camera is better and wide lens, more emojis for texting, etc. I haven't charged the phone at all since 6:00 AM this morning and have been playing with it, updating apps, installing, etc. and the battery is still going strong from this morning.

When you get the phone it walks you through set up which just took a few minutes. Meaning it let me enter a new password, set up my language, time zone, etc. I believe it asked about font size, etc as well, it was all easy setup - nothing really stymied me which I was grateful for.

To put it through its paces, I emailed, texted, called, received calls, took photos, surfed the net, downloaded form the App store, etc and thus far no issues and at this point I don't anticipate any.

Spending the additional $$ for the latest and supposedly greatest iPhone isn't necessary for me - and I don't have to deal with ""new"" issues the latest phones sometimes have.  In summary, I would definitely buy unlocked and renewed again.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/9R1X8TCULFHXOWB,A5I3NVMM2GW45KE,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.YOWNIS9ULVHRKSD,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2025",False,,I5YTOUB9N8,True

32HYVHA0ZHYBCG9,Could be better,"The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.

[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]

My issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.
1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we‚Äôd be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.

2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help.

If you're in the market for a smartphone that seamlessly marries cutting-edge technology with sleek design, look no further than the Apple iPhone 11. As a devoted Apple enthusiast, I recently upgraded to this model, and I must say, it's exceeded my already high expectations.

Let's start with the design. The iPhone 11 boasts a stunning 6.1-inch Liquid Retina HD display that truly brings everything to life, from vibrant photos to immersive gaming experiences. The build quality is impeccable, with a robust aerospace-grade aluminum and glass construction that feels premium in the hand. The matte finish on the back not only looks sophisticated but also minimizes fingerprints, which is a practical touch.

Performance-wise, the iPhone 11 is a powerhouse. The A13 Bionic chip ensures lightning-fast responsiveness, whether you're multitasking between apps, editing videos on the go, or playing graphics-intensive games. This phone handles it all effortlessly. Plus, with iOS, you get the smoothest, most intuitive user experience in the smartphone world. Updates are timely, and the ecosystem seamlessly integrates with other Apple devices if you're part of the ecosystem.

Now, let's talk about the camera setup‚Äîa standout feature of the iPhone 11. The dual-camera system (12MP Ultra Wide and Wide cameras) captures stunning photos with impressive detail and color accuracy. Night mode is a game-changer, allowing you to take beautifully illuminated shots even in low-light conditions. The ability to shoot 4K videos at 60fps with extended dynamic range further showcases the iPhone 11's imaging prowess.

Battery life has been another pleasant surprise. The iPhone 11 easily lasts me through a full day of heavy use, thanks to optimizations in hardware and software. Fast charging support means I can quickly top up when needed, which is incredibly convenient.

As for connectivity, having the iPhone 11 unlocked gives me the flexibility to switch between carriers without any hassle. It supports 4G LTE and the latest Wi-Fi standards, ensuring a stable and speedy connection wherever I go.

In terms of value, the iPhone 11 hits the sweet spot. It offers flagship-level performance and features without the premium price tag of the Pro models. The 64GB storage variant provides ample space for apps, photos, and videos, but you can always opt for higher capacities if needed.

In conclusion, the Apple iPhone 11 is a triumph of design, performance, and value. Whether you're an Apple aficionado or simply looking for a top-tier smartphone experience, this device delivers on all fronts. It's reliable, versatile, and beautifully crafted‚Äîa true testament to Apple's commitment to innovation. I wholeheartedly recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone seeking a dependable and feature-rich mobile companion.",1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/J9YF0WSJVIZVMM0,NCVNKIKONGU7G1J,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.XNJQN8VAJXY433N,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2025",True,,OPIEG47VVO,True

P5E02ZFKU84QSLK,Probably should have gotten the warranty,"Update:  I'm back with an update on our journey with the iPhone 11, and let me tell you, it's been quite the rollercoaster. Initially, I bought one for my daughter from a different seller, and it was, to put it mildly, a bit of a disaster. We had issues left and right ‚Äì Face ID not working, the phone overheating ‚Äì you name it. So, we returned it, feeling a bit skeptical about the whole refurbished scene.

But here's where the plot twists: we decided to give it another go, this time purchasing from the Amazon resellers store, specifically from a shop called Hybrid IT. And oh boy, what a difference! The iPhone we received this time around was nothing short of impeccable. It arrived with all the essentials ‚Äì a charger, a charging cable, and even a SIM card tool, all neatly packed. The phone itself? It could've fooled me for brand new.

This experience really hammered home the lesson that when it comes to refurbished goods, the ""who"" is just as crucial as the ""what."" The quality and condition of the product can vary wildly depending on the seller. Hybrid IT sent out an excellent product that exceeded our expectations in every way.

For those of you wary about diving into the world of refurbished electronics, let this be a testament. With the right seller, you can get your hands on a device that feels brand new, without the hefty price tag. We're over the moon with our iPhone 11, and I'll be sure to keep you all posted if anything changes. But for now, it seems like we've struck gold.

--------------------

I recently found myself in need of a quick replacement after my daughter accidentally broke her phone. The Apple iPhone 11, 64GB in black, seemed like a promising choice, primarily because we needed something that could be set up swiftly and would perform seamlessly as a backup.

Out of the box, the iPhone 11 felt like a brand-new device despite being a model released a few years back. The sleek black finish and the familiar design immediately caught my eye, reassuring me that this choice would not disappoint.

Setting up the iPhone 11 was mostly straightforward, especially with the unlocked version making it easy to switch from the old device. The transfer of data and settings from the previous iPhone was seamless, thanks to Apple's ecosystem. However, we hit a slight snag with the Face ID setup - it took a bit longer than expected to get it working properly. Despite this hiccup, once configured, Face ID has been working flawlessly.

The iPhone 11's performance has been impressive. The touch screen is responsive, making navigation and typing a breeze. Wi-Fi connectivity is fast, ensuring that browsing and app downloads are efficient. Although it's not the latest model, it handles everyday tasks with ease, from streaming video content to gaming, without any noticeable lag.

The main issue we encountered was the initial difficulty in setting up Face ID. It required a few attempts to configure, which was a minor inconvenience in an otherwise smooth setup process. After overcoming this challenge, the phone has been working perfectly.

Overall, this refurbished Apple iPhone 11 has proven to be a reliable and efficient backup phone. Its ease of setup, fast Wi-Fi, and responsive touch screen make it feel like a new device. The hiccup with Face ID setup was a small obstacle that, once overcome, didn't detract from the overall positive experience. I would recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone in need of a quick replacement or a dependable backup device",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RESNZH44V0TH14R,9HB6LMYCSFF6IB2,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.Z3YW4EVNAMXMF64,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on May 08, 2025",False,,AFKINC15MT,False

RWJ4XDAMQPV9EW6,Buyer beware,"‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Amazing Quality ‚Äì Bought Two and Both Were Perfect!

I originally bought one of these refurbished iPhone 11s (64GB, green, unlocked) on Amazon and was seriously impressed. It looked brand new ‚Äî not a single scratch ‚Äî and everything worked perfectly right out of the box. I ended up gifting that first one to my daughter, and she absolutely loves it. No issues at all.

Because the first one was such a great buy, I decided to order another and gift it to my niece. Same experience again ‚Äî flawless condition, beautifully packaged, and fully functional. No defects, no problems, just a great phone at a great price.

If you‚Äôre on the fence about getting a refurbished iPhone on Amazon, this is 100% worth it. Great value, great quality, and you really can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs not new.

XX1L3FU3GJ8LON4,Great product,"I needed a new unlocked iPhone for my wife, since her 6 plus cannot run on any recent IOS iterations and is getting dropped by our mobile carrier.  Sooo, a used 11 seemed a logical choice, since her needs are minimal.  I have one as well and love it (no plans to upgrade).

After hunting around for about a week, I finally committed.  The phone arrived early and properly packaged.  There were some scratches on the edges, but only one of note.  It even had a (perfect) screen protector.  It was unlocked, easy to set up, and seems to run flawlessly.  The battery reserve so far is okay, although iPhone Settings claim it is an aftermarket replacement, and cannot tell me anything about battery health.  Battery issues ae commonly reported with used phones, but mine seems fine.

A couple of minor issues.  While the edge scratches were not functional, they were borderline for condition rated as ""excellent.""  Also, when ordering, play the extra $5 for FedEx or UPS delivery.  Ours came USPS and arrived unexpected early.  It was left on the top of our mailbox, but I was able to get it before heading off for a short trip.

To sum up, this was a good phone at a decent price (about$225 with 128 GB memory).  When my phone needs replacement, I would go with this seller again, but would not buy anything rated less than ""excellent condition"".",1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/PF804USFGFHDYSV,U5MF3F1XTM3ANXY,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.RK4JHEPJ4FFL22E,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2025",False,,TBIXJ5PZZI,False

I switched my sim card over from my other phone too, no problems or concerns there, it shows up as unlocked. I love the Iphone 11 and it was a deal to get an extra 128gb of storage too. I just hate that I‚Äôll have to get the battery replaced, didn‚Äôt plan on investing in this phone so soon. Because when I charge it when it gets to a low percentage, it kind of fluctuates before the percentage starts to go up and thats a little annoying. As you can see tho, it can get to full charge no issue except that. So overall, I‚Äôm happy with my purchase, its more than I expected at least.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/8PQ02Y0MW5ZAHL9,RX28V3YEKPQ9U8G,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.J9G412F6TPCPVNZ,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on March 08, 2025",False,,CA3EF10FKX,True

V5TAAY8QPHSQLD6,It‚Äôs worth it,"I honestly can‚Äôt say enough amazing things about my experience buying a renewed iPhone 11 from this seller and dealing with their customer service! I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won‚Äôt be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.

My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn‚Äôt brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.

The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn‚Äôt love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn‚Äôt deliver it until 10pm! But that‚Äôs an issue with UPS, not the seller.

When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn‚Äôt pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn‚Äôt great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.

The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they‚Äôd overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn‚Äôt be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they‚Äôd overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn‚Äôt want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I‚Äôd reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I‚Äôd be sending it back with it on.

Life got hectic and I didn‚Äôt reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.

I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn‚Äôt ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn‚Äôt want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don‚Äôt have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.

When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn‚Äôt going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).

When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn‚Äôt a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It‚Äôs also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!

I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!

Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/5B76S5QKK9MYSH2,0R5WMX5NOS8CW4S,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.VCW0XU65MXW024R,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2025",True,,HNAO4LITW7,True
D9ZK3VUUEDXFJJZ,Unexpected After Market Battery but Nice Otherwise,"I bought the iPhone 11 on Amazon and it honestly exceeded all my expectations. The item arrived in perfect condition, well-packaged, and within the estimated delivery time. From the first use, the phone felt fast, smooth, and the display quality was excellent.

The camera is simply outstanding, especially for well-lit photos or portrait mode shots. The battery lasts a long time, and the operating system runs flawlessly. Plus, the design still looks modern and sleek, even though it‚Äôs not the newest model.

The best part was the value for the price. Compared to other stores, I found a deal on Amazon that was truly worth it. For what I paid, there‚Äôs no other phone that offers as much.

Q5I2JJKWJUBPEXW,iPhone,"EDIT: Our daughter was given the phone a few days ago and it has been working great! There is one spot on the right side of the screen that is lighter than anywhere else. The only thing I can think of that would be causing it is something underneath is pressing up against the back side of a recently replaced screen. It's there regardless of what is showing on the screen. All colors and any image and you can still see a small white area that never gets color and then fades into the normal looking screen. It's so small, it's almost unnoticeable. I only put it in the review in case it is indeed something behind the screen and eventually causes issues. Currently, I am happy with the phone. Our daughter loves it and it appears to function perfectly!

Original Review: So far the phone is great! There doesn't appear to be any cosmetic issues at all. The phone turned on, loaded up and accepted my daughter's account login. Battery health is perfect, storage capacity is correct for my order. We won't actually be giving it to our daughter till her birthday in a couple weeks but preliminary inspection went well. Will update the review once we start actually using it but I am happy with the phone so far

CG81YG417KLS6I5,Perfect!,"I ordered this device expecting it to meet the advertised guarantee of at least 80% battery capacity, but upon checking, the battery health was only 76%. While the phone looks fine physically, battery life is noticeably shorter than expected.

N0E4ZZYN0W9ZNLZ,Not as described,"My iPhone 6 died and was only iOS 10 so it was time to get a new phone. After much deliberation I decided to buy the Apple iPhone 11, US Version, 128GB, Green - Unlocked (Renewed) and couldn't be happier. It looks brand new, literally not one scuff mark, the battery was at 82% life but for $329.00 I got the phone, a charger (cord and block) and a clear protective case with iOS 16 installed. Way cheaper than buying new. I also liked that it's not a huge phone, 6.1 inches.

I was concerned as my old phone completely died so I wasn't sure how to get Apple ID and all on the new phone as I don't have a landline or other phone. I googled and learned to just select lost password at the Apple ID prompt, it allowed me to reset my Apple password by asking for my old phone's passcode to open.  The sim card transfer was a piece of cake too for this non techy.  I love all the new things the iPhone 11 can do, easier deleting some things, the camera is better and wide lens, more emojis for texting, etc. I haven't charged the phone at all since 6:00 AM this morning and have been playing with it, updating apps, installing, etc. and the battery is still going strong from this morning.

When you get the phone it walks you through set up which just took a few minutes. Meaning it let me enter a new password, set up my language, time zone, etc. I believe it asked about font size, etc as well, it was all easy setup - nothing really stymied me which I was grateful for.

To put it through its paces, I emailed, texted, called, received calls, took photos, surfed the net, downloaded form the App store, etc and thus far no issues and at this point I don't anticipate any.

Spending the additional $$ for the latest and supposedly greatest iPhone isn't necessary for me - and I don't have to deal with ""new"" issues the latest phones sometimes have.  In summary, I would definitely buy unlocked and renewed again.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/DJSRCIQLB83YYVK,1BURRYS25FDV0IP,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.MTF90LC5V4F6BM2,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2025",True,,GYUBTF0MEH,False
J482VIWKGENT5LJ,Waste of money,"The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.

[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]

My issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.
1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we‚Äôd be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.

2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website.

72BHVC1AXPU0DUW,Love it!,"EDIT: Our daughter was given the phone a few days ago and it has been working great! There is one spot on the right side of the screen that is lighter than anywhere else. The only thing I can think of that would be causing it is something underneath is pressing up against the back side of a recently replaced screen. It's there regardless of what is showing on the screen. All colors and any image and you can still see a small white area that never gets color and then fades into the normal looking screen. It's so small, it's almost unnoticeable. I only put it in the review in case it is indeed something behind the screen and eventually causes issues. Currently, I am happy with the phone. Our daughter loves it and it appears to function perfectly!

Original Review: So far the phone is great! There doesn't appear to be any cosmetic issues at all. The phone turned on, loaded up and accepted my daughter's account login. Battery health is perfect, storage capacity is correct for my order. We won't actually be giving it to our daughter till her birthday in a couple weeks but preliminary inspection went well. Will update the review once we start actually using it but I am happy with the phone so far

R3QP6ILZZCF2Z35,Arrived on time,"‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Amazing Quality ‚Äì Bought Two and Both Were Perfect!

I originally bought one of these refurbished iPhone 11s (64GB, green, unlocked) on Amazon and was seriously impressed. It looked brand new ‚Äî not a single scratch ‚Äî and everything worked perfectly right out of the box. I ended up gifting that first one to my daughter, and she absolutely loves it. No issues at all.

Because the first one was such a great buy, I decided to order another and gift it to my niece. Same experience again ‚Äî flawless condition, beautifully packaged, and fully functional. No defects, no problems, just a great phone at a great price.

If you‚Äôre on the fence about getting a refurbished iPhone on Amazon, this is 100% worth it. Great value, great quality, and you really can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs not new.

UVSDDD3T4OERRCG,Buena relaci√≥n costo beneficio,"The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.

[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]

My issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.
1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we‚Äôd be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.

2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website. Hope others have an easier time with setup.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/1NBV80Q3UFMDANB,VVY5HSJ3YU93ARC,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.QH5FTQJ574DJZEK,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on February 08, 2025",True,,5AFWEFZUJE,True

69GBI3CJ3TZHKPV,Battery Life Low,"I ordered this phone and received it in less than 4 days. I chose the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition out of all the renewed options. It is a lot bigger than I expected, but then again, I didn‚Äôt check the dimensions before I ordered it. The phone was packaged in a single bubble wrap sleeve. The box it came in contained a wall adapter and charging cable. The phone is almost flawless except for some scuff marks around the charging port. There are also some scuff marks around the volume up button.

I like that the color of the iPhone is a muted lavender color rather than a vibrant purple. The phone came with a screen protector already installed. I didn‚Äôt realize this until hours later while I was setting up the phone. The battery health is set at 90%, and this was written on the bubble wrap sleeve.

The one thing I will say about this phone is that it does lack a working left speaker on the bottom. The other reviews all seem to mention the speaker problem, and I hate to agree. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but I do wish the audio was up to par with the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition the phone is supposed to be in.

By the way, this phone was sold to me by Electronic Deals. They seem to have a slightly above average reputation. I love the fact it has 128gb of storage.

6958ITXJE7G4T9J,If I can do it you can do it!,"I ordered this phone and received it in less than 4 days. I chose the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition out of all the renewed options. It is a lot bigger than I expected, but then again, I didn‚Äôt check the dimensions before I ordered it. The phone was packaged in a single bubble wrap sleeve. The box it came in contained a wall adapter and charging cable. The phone is almost flawless except for some scuff marks around the charging port. There are also some scuff marks around the volume up button.

I like that the color of the iPhone is a muted lavender color rather than a vibrant purple. The phone came with a screen protector already installed. I didn‚Äôt realize this until hours later while I was setting up the phone. The battery health is set at 90%, and this was written on the bubble wrap sleeve.

The one thing I will say about this phone is that it does lack a working left speaker on the bottom. The other reviews all seem to mention the speaker problem, and I hate to agree. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but I do wish the audio was up to par with the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition the phone is supposed to be in.

By the way, this phone was sold to me by Electronic Deals. They seem to have a slightly above average reputation. I love the fact it has 128gb of storage.

RWP155GEQYT6VA1,okay product,"I purchased this refurbished iPhone 11 listed as ‚ÄúGood‚Äù condition, and while the phone functions fine, the screen arrived with noticeable damage.

BZD7IEXW0Q8G8OT,Poor quality,"EDIT: Our daughter was given the phone a few days ago and it has been working great! There is one spot on the right side of the screen that is lighter than anywhere else. The only thing I can think of that would be causing it is something underneath is pressing up against the back side of a recently replaced screen. It's there regardless of what is showing on the screen. All colors and any image and you can still see a small white area that never gets color and then fades into the normal looking screen. It's so small, it's almost unnoticeable. I only put it in the review in case it is indeed something behind the screen and eventually causes issues. Currently, I am happy with the phone. Our daughter loves it and it appears to function perfectly!

Original Review: So far the phone is great! There doesn't appear to be any cosmetic issues at all. The phone turned on, loaded up and accepted my daughter's account login. Battery health is perfect, storage capacity is correct for my order. We won't actually be giving it to our daughter till her birthday in a couple weeks but preliminary inspection went well. Will update the review once we start actually using it but I am happy with the phone so far

92THLK0MUNF68VE,Easy setup and Go,"The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.

[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]

My issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.
1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we‚Äôd be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.

2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website. Hope others have an easier time with setup.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/WZYG0TV3DTXHT4J,OM8K0XZBKLGVCIX,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.EJWZRQMWH5HEGAO,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2025",False,,5S2Q29HPU1,False

NDIZXM8WZ0FJL84,Purple iPhone 11~,"I bought the iPhone 11 on Amazon and it honestly exceeded all my expectations. The item arrived in perfect condition, well-packaged, and within the estimated delivery time. From the first use, the phone felt fast, smooth, and the display quality was excellent.

The camera is simply outstanding, especially for well-lit photos or portrait mode shots. The battery lasts a long time, and the operating system runs flawlessly. Plus, the design still looks modern and sleek, even though it‚Äôs not the newest model.

The best part was the value for the price. Compared to other stores, I found a deal on Amazon that was truly worth it. For what I paid, there‚Äôs no other phone that offers as much.

I switched my sim card over from my other phone too, no problems or concerns there, it shows up as unlocked. I love the Iphone 11 and it was a deal to get an extra 128gb of storage too.

YA5MGNKGFVF6AOY,Solid Device,"EDIT: Our daughter was given the phone a few days ago and it has been working great! There is one spot on the right side of the screen that is lighter than anywhere else. The only thing I can think of that would be causing it is something underneath is pressing up against the back side of a recently replaced screen. It's there regardless of what is showing on the screen. All colors and any image and you can still see a small white area that never gets color and then fades into the normal looking screen. It's so small, it's almost unnoticeable. I only put it in the review in case it is indeed something behind the screen and eventually causes issues. Currently, I am happy with the phone. Our daughter loves it and it appears to function perfectly!

Original Review: So far the phone is great! There doesn't appear to be any cosmetic issues at all. The phone turned on, loaded up and accepted my daughter's account login. Battery health is perfect, storage capacity is correct for my order. We won't actually be giving it to our daughter till her birthday in a couple weeks but preliminary inspection went well. Will update the review once we start actually using it but I am happy with the phone so far

JZVOGY1H3QN0MCU,Apple iPhone 11 Review: A Reliable Backup That Feels Like New,"‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

If you're in the market for a smartphone that seamlessly marries cutting-edge technology with sleek design, look no further than the Apple iPhone 11. As a devoted Apple enthusiast, I recently upgraded to this model, and I must say, it's exceeded my already high expectations.

Let's start with the design. The iPhone 11 boasts a stunning 6.1-inch Liquid Retina HD display that truly brings everything to life, from vibrant photos to immersive gaming experiences. The build quality is impeccable, with a robust aerospace-grade aluminum and glass construction that feels premium in the hand. The matte finish on the back not only looks sophisticated but also minimizes fingerprints, which is a practical touch.

Performance-wise, the iPhone 11 is a powerhouse. The A13 Bionic chip ensures lightning-fast responsiveness, whether you're multitasking between apps, editing videos on the go, or playing graphics-intensive games. This phone handles it all effortlessly. Plus, with iOS, you get the smoothest, most intuitive user experience in the smartphone world. Updates are timely, and the ecosystem seamlessly integrates with other Apple devices if you're part of the ecosystem.

Now, let's talk about the camera setup‚Äîa standout feature of the iPhone 11. The dual-camera system (12MP Ultra Wide and Wide cameras) captures stunning photos with impressive detail and color accuracy. Night mode is a game-changer, allowing you to take beautifully illuminated shots even in low-light conditions. The ability to shoot 4K videos at 60fps with extended dynamic range further showcases the iPhone 11's imaging prowess.

Battery life has been another pleasant surprise. The iPhone 11 easily lasts me through a full day of heavy use, thanks to optimizations in hardware and software. Fast charging support means I can quickly top up when needed, which is incredibly convenient.

As for connectivity, having the iPhone 11 unlocked gives me the flexibility to switch between carriers without any hassle. It supports 4G LTE and the latest Wi-Fi standards, ensuring a stable and speedy connection wherever I go.

In terms of value, the iPhone 11 hits the sweet spot. It offers flagship-level performance and features without the premium price tag of the Pro models. The 64GB storage variant provides ample space for apps, photos, and videos, but you can always opt for higher capacities if needed.

In conclusion, the Apple iPhone 11 is a triumph of design, performance, and value. Whether you're an Apple aficionado or simply looking for a top-tier smartphone experience, this device delivers on all fronts. It's reliable, versatile, and beautifully crafted‚Äîa true testament to Apple's commitment to innovation. I wholeheartedly recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone seeking a dependable and feature-rich mobile companion.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/86Q2G8XQD2IWIPY,8C1RJJE57JWX9VL,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.RVYC6X1BEAT19L4,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2025",True,,1S28BW2TAZ,False

VTWN8KMAAEJUFFQ,Great phone,"The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.

[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]

My issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.
1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we‚Äôd be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.

2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website. Hope others have an easier time with setup.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/2H2QFDELJY8504K,9UVKJUM875VBXNU,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.O75HZD6HEQAY2UR,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on June 03, 2025",True,,NZH2BD4WFG,False

If you're in the market for a smartphone that seamlessly marries cutting-edge technology with sleek design, look no further than the Apple iPhone 11. As a devoted Apple enthusiast, I recently upgraded to this model, and I must say, it's exceeded my already high expectations.

Let's start with the design. The iPhone 11 boasts a stunning 6.1-inch Liquid Retina HD display that truly brings everything to life, from vibrant photos to immersive gaming experiences. The build quality is impeccable, with a robust aerospace-grade aluminum and glass construction that feels premium in the hand. The matte finish on the back not only looks sophisticated but also minimizes fingerprints, which is a practical touch.

Performance-wise, the iPhone 11 is a powerhouse. The A13 Bionic chip ensures lightning-fast responsiveness, whether you're multitasking between apps, editing videos on the go, or playing graphics-intensive games. This phone handles it all effortlessly. Plus, with iOS, you get the smoothest, most intuitive user experience in the smartphone world. Updates are timely, and the ecosystem seamlessly integrates with other Apple devices if you're part of the ecosystem.

Now, let's talk about the camera setup‚Äîa standout feature of the iPhone 11. The dual-camera system (12MP Ultra Wide and Wide cameras) captures stunning photos with impressive detail and color accuracy. Night mode is a game-changer, allowing you to take beautifully illuminated shots even in low-light conditions. The ability to shoot 4K videos at 60fps with extended dynamic range further showcases the iPhone 11's imaging prowess.

Battery life has been another pleasant surprise. The iPhone 11 easily lasts me through a full day of heavy use, thanks to optimizations in hardware and software. Fast charging support means I can quickly top up when needed, which is incredibly convenient.

As for connectivity, having the iPhone 11 unlocked gives me the flexibility to switch between carriers without any hassle. It supports 4G LTE and the latest Wi-Fi standards, ensuring a stable and speedy connection wherever I go.

In terms of value, the iPhone 11 hits the sweet spot. It offers flagship-level performance and features without the premium price tag of the Pro models. The 64GB storage variant provides ample space for apps, photos, and videos, but you can always opt for higher capacities if needed.

In conclusion, the Apple iPhone 11 is a triumph of design, performance, and value. Whether you're an Apple aficionado or simply looking for a top-tier smartphone experience, this device delivers on all fronts. It's reliable, versatile, and beautifully crafted‚Äîa true testament to Apple's commitment to innovation. I wholeheartedly recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone seeking a dependable and feature-rich mobile companion.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/O2QF9A3VDYUUXEY,R86H8SPVPSFBFWS,John Doe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.6T5VK0KIDYE2W4I,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,750,750_SX48_.jpg",[],[],"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2025",True,,2N0CZR93U4,False
